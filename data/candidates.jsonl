It usually occurs from the 20th week of pregnancy to 7 days postpartum. The cause is unknown. It is also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension or toxemia of pregnancy.\nECLAMPSIA\nis the end-stage of the pre-eclampsia process. The vast majority of women who develop pre-eclampsia are pregnant with their first child and are towards the end of their child-bearing years. There are identifiable risk factors for developing pre-eclampsia: family history of pre-eclampsia, previous pregnancy with pre-eclampsia, multiple gestation, and a hydatiform mole (an intrauterine growth that mimics pregnancy). A chronic high blood pressure and underlying blood vessel disease increases the risk. Pre-eclampsia ranges from mild to severe to eclampsia as the end-stage. Untreated pre-eclampsia can result in a stroke, fluid-build up around the lungs, kidney failure, death of baby and death of mother.\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:\nMILD PRE-ECLAMPSIA:\n* Significant blood pressure increase even if you are still within the normal blood pressure limits.\n* Swelling in the face, hands and feet which worsens in the a.m.\n* Gaining more than a pound a week, especially in the last trimester.\n* Routine prenatal checkup reveals protein in the urine.\n* Seizures are possible.\nSEVERE PRE-ECLAMPSIA:\n* More blood pressure increase.\n* Further swelling in face, hands and feet.\n* Visual disturbances.\n* Headache.\n* Irritability.\n* Abdominal pain.\n* Tiredness.\n* Decreased urination.\n* Seizures possible.\n* Nausea and vomiting.\nECLAMPSIA:\n* Symptoms worsen.\n* Seizures.\n* Muscle twitches.\n* Coma.\nTREATMENT:\n* Diagnosis - blood tests, urinalysis, blood pressure monitoring.\n* Mild preeclampsia can be treated at home. Severe symptoms require hospitalization and possible early delivery of the baby, often by cesarean section.\n* Daily weighing.\n* Daily monitoring for protein in urine.\n* Medications to lower blood pressure if preeclampsia is severe.\n* Magnesium sulfate or other anti-seizure drugs may be necessary to prevent seizures.\n* Get lots of rest! Lay on your left side to help circulation.\n* Follow any dietary advice given by your doctor.\n* Get regular prenatal checkups! Eat a nutritious diet and take your vitamin supplements.\n* Never take any medications that are not prescribed or recommended by your physician.\n* Call the office if your headaches become severe, you have visual disturbances or if you gain more than 3 pounds in 24 hours.\nRESTRICTING CAFFEINE:\nYou should reduce your intake of caffeine by cutting back on coffee and other caffeinated beverages like soda. In addition, you should avoid chocolate that also contains caffeine.\nRESTRICTING SALT:\nYou are to restrict your salt intake by reducing or eliminating table salt from your meals and avoiding foods that are high in salt concentration. For more information about which foods are high in salt, read the label of any foods you intend to consume and look for sodium content.\nKeywords:\nobstetrics / gynecology, central nervous system, intrauterine growth, pre eclampsia, blood pressure, pregnancy, preeclampsia, eclampsia,"}

Hypertension.\n3. Hyperlipidemia.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThe patient is a 39-year-old woman returns for followup management of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Her last visit was approximately 4 months ago. Since that time, the patient states her health had been good and her glycemic control had been good, however, within the past 2 weeks she had a pump malfunction, had to get a new pump and was not certain of her pump settings and has been having some difficulty with glycemic control over the past 2 weeks. She is not reporting any severe hypoglycemic events, but is having some difficulty with hyperglycemia both fasting and postprandial. She is not reporting polyuria, polydipsia or polyphagia. She is not exercising at this point and has a diet that is rather typical of woman with twins and a young single child as well. She is working on a full-time basis and so eats on the run a lot, probably eats more than she should and not making the best choices, little time for physical activity. She is keeping up with all her other appointments and has recently had a good eye examination. She had lab work done at her previous visit and this revealed persistent hyperlipidemic state with a LDL of 144.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n1. Zoloft 50 mg p.o. once daily.\n2.

The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort. In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic. He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts. In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nObtained from the medical chart. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia.\nMEDICATIONS:\nPer his current medical chart.\nALLERGIES:\nNO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nThe patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago. He does have chronic alcohol use.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGENERAL: A very thin white male who is dyspneic and having difficulty breathing at the moment.\nVITAL SIGNS: Afebrile. Heart rate in the 100s to 120s at times with atrial fibrillation. Respiratory rate is 17-20. Blood pressure 130s-150s/60s-70s.\nNECK: Soft and supple, full range of motion.\nHEART: Regular.\nABDOMEN: Distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information. He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.\nDIAGNOSTICS:\nA CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.\nASSESSMENT:\nPossible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.\nPLAN:\nThe patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago. Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time. The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state. So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.\nKeywords:\ngastroenterology, ischemic cecum, metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, copd, anemia, gastric ulcer, pneumatosis coli, cecum, aspiration pneumonia, aspiration, ischemic, atrial, metastatic, hydronephrosis, fibrillation, pneumatosis, pneumonia,"}

TSH is 1.07 and free T4 is 0.81.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. This is a return visit to the endocrine clinic for the patient, a 39-year-old woman with history as noted above. Plan today is to make adjustments to her pump based on a total daily dose of 90 units of insulin. Basal rate is as follows, 12 a.m. 1.5, 02:30 a.m. 1.75, and 6 a.m. 1.5. Her correction factor is 19. Her carb/insulin ratio is 6. Her active insulin time is 5 and her targets are at 12 a.m. 110 and 6 a.m. to midnight is 100. We made adjustments to her pump and the plan will be to see her back in approximately 2 months.\n2. Hyperlipidemia. The patient is not taking statin, therefore, we will prescribe Lipitor 20 mg one p.o. once daily. Have her watch for side effects from the medication and plan to do a fasting lipid panel and CMP approximately 8 weeks from now.\n3. We will get a hemoglobin A1c and spot urine for albumin in 8 weeks as well.\nKeywords:\nendocrinology, endocrine clinic, insulin pump, diabetes mellitus, insulin, glycemic, fasting, polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, diabetes,"}

The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort. In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic. He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts. In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nObtained from the medical chart. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia.\nMEDICATIONS:\nPer his current medical chart.\nALLERGIES:\nNO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nThe patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago. He does have chronic alcohol use.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGENERAL: A very thin white male who is dyspneic and having difficulty breathing at the moment.\nVITAL SIGNS: Afebrile. Heart rate in the 100s to 120s at times with atrial fibrillation. Respiratory rate is 17-20. Blood pressure 130s-150s/60s-70s.\nNECK: Soft and supple, full range of motion.\nHEART: Regular.\nABDOMEN: Distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information. He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.\nDIAGNOSTICS:\nA CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.\nASSESSMENT:\nPossible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.\nPLAN:\nThe patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago. Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time. The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state. So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.\nKeywords:\nconsult - history and phy., ischemic cecum, metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, copd, anemia, gastric ulcer, pneumatosis coli, cecum, aspiration pneumonia, aspiration, ischemic, atrial, metastatic, hydronephrosis, fibrillation, pneumatosis, pneumonia,"}

Her last visit to this clinic was approximately three months ago. Since that time, the patient states that she has had some variability in her glucose control too largely to recent upper and lower respiratory illnesses. She did not seek attention for these, and the symptoms have begun to subside on their own and in the meantime, she continues to have some difficulties with blood sugar management. Her 14-day average is 191. She had a high blood sugar this morning, which she attributed to a problem with her infusion set; however, in the clinic after an appropriate correction bolus, she subsequently became quite low. She was treated appropriately with glucose and crackers, and her blood sugar came back up to over 100. She was able to manage this completely on her own. In the meantime, she is not having any other medical problems that have interfered with glucose control. Her diet has been a little bit different in that she had been away visiting with her family for some period of time as well.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n1. A number of topical creams for her rash.\n2.

Aspirin 81 mg a day.\n17. Lasix 20 mg a day.\n18. Levothyroxine 75 micrograms a day.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nReally not much change. Her upper respiratory symptoms have resolved. She is not describing fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea or abdominal pain. She is not having any decreased appetite. She is not having painful urination, any blood in the urine, frequency or hesitancy. She is not having polyuria, polydipsia or polyphagia. Her visual acuity has declined, but she does not appear to have any acute change.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS: Temperature 36.1, pulse 56, respirations 16, blood pressure 117/48, and weight is 109.7 pounds. HEENT: Examination found her to be atraumatic and normocephalic. She has pupils that are equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular muscles intact. Sclerae and conjunctivae are clear. The paranasal sinuses are nontender. The nose is patent. The external auditory canal and tympanic membranes are clear A.U. Oral cavity and oropharynx examination is free of lesions. The mucosus membranes are moist. NECK: Supple. There is no lymphadenopathy. There is no thyromegaly. THORAX: Reveals lungs that are clear, PA and lateral, without adventitious sounds. CARDIOVASCULAR: Demonstrated regular rate and rhythm. EXTREMITIES: Reveal no edema and is otherwise deferred.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThis is a return visit to the renal clinic for the patient with history as noted above. She has had variability in her glucose control, and the plan today is to continue her current regimen, which includes the following: Basal rate, 12 a.m. 0.6 units per hour, 4 a.m. 0.7 units per hour, and 9 a.m. 0.6 units per hour. Her target pre-meal is 120 and bedtime is 150. Her insulin/carbohydrate ratio is 10 and her correction factor is 60. We are not going to make any changes to her insulin pump settings at this time. I have encouraged her to watch the number of processed high-calorie foods that she is consuming late at night. She has agreed to try that and cut back on this a little bit. I want to get fasting labs to include her standard labs for us today but include a fasting C-peptide and a hemoglobin A1C, so that we can make arrangements for her to get an upgraded insulin pump. She states to me that she has been having some battery problems in the recent past, although she says the last time that she went four weeks without having to change batteries and that is about the appropriate amount of time. Nonetheless, she is out of warranty and we will try to get her a new pump.\nPlan to see the patient back here in approximately two months, and we will try to get the new pump through Medicare.\nKeywords:\nnephrology, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, renal clinic, glucose control, blood sugar, insulin pump, insulin, kidney, peripheral, glucose,"}

He comes in today with his daughter. He has had no symptoms of CAD or CHF. He had followup with Dr. X and she thought he was doing quite well as well. He has had no symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. He has had no falls. His right knee does pain him at times and he is using occasional doses of Tylenol for that.

Doing self-blood glucose monitoring with values in the morning between 100 and 130. Continue current regimen. Recheck A1c on return.\n3. Hyperlipidemia, at last visit, he had 3+ protein in his urine. TSH was normal. We will get a 24-hour urine to rule out nephrosis as the cause of his hypertriglyceridemia. In the interim, both Dr. X and I have been considering together as to whether the patient should have an agent added to treat his hypertriglyceridemia. Specifically we were considering TriCor (fenofibrate). Given his problems with high CPK values in the past for now, we have decided not to engage in that strategy. We will leave open for the future. Check fasting lipid panel today.\n4. Chronic renal insufficiency, improved with reduction in dose of Bumex over time.\n5. Arthritis, stable. I told the patient he could use Extra Strength Tylenol up to 4 grams a day, but I suggest that he start with a regular dose of 1 to 2 to 3 grams per day. He states he will inch that up slowly. With regard to a brace, he stated he used one in the past and that did not help very much. I worry a little bit about the tourniquet type effect of a brace that could increase his edema or put him at risk for venous thromboembolic disease.

Diabetic retinopathy.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThis is a return visit to the renal clinic for the patient where she is followed up for diabetes and kidney disease management. Her last visit to this clinic was approximately three months ago. Since that time, the patient states that she has had some variability in her glucose control too largely to recent upper and lower respiratory illnesses. She did not seek attention for these, and the symptoms have begun to subside on their own and in the meantime, she continues to have some difficulties with blood sugar management. Her 14-day average is 191. She had a high blood sugar this morning, which she attributed to a problem with her infusion set; however, in the clinic after an appropriate correction bolus, she subsequently became quite low. She was treated appropriately with glucose and crackers, and her blood sugar came back up to over 100. She was able to manage this completely on her own. In the meantime, she is not having any other medical problems that have interfered with glucose control. Her diet has been a little bit different in that she had been away visiting with her family for some period of time as well.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n1. A number of topical creams for her rash.\n2. Hydroxyzine 25 mg 4 times a day.\n3. Claritin 5 mg a day.\n4. Fluoxetine 20 mg a day.\n5. Ergocalciferol 800 international units a day.\n6. Protonix 40 mg a day.\n7.

Aspirin 81 mg a day.\n17. Lasix 20 mg a day.\n18. Levothyroxine 75 micrograms a day.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nReally not much change. Her upper respiratory symptoms have resolved. She is not describing fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea or abdominal pain. She is not having any decreased appetite. She is not having painful urination, any blood in the urine, frequency or hesitancy. She is not having polyuria, polydipsia or polyphagia. Her visual acuity has declined, but she does not appear to have any acute change.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS: Temperature 36.1, pulse 56, respirations 16, blood pressure 117/48, and weight is 109.7 pounds. HEENT: Examination found her to be atraumatic and normocephalic. She has pupils that are equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular muscles intact. Sclerae and conjunctivae are clear. The paranasal sinuses are nontender. The nose is patent. The external auditory canal and tympanic membranes are clear A.U. Oral cavity and oropharynx examination is free of lesions. The mucosus membranes are moist. NECK: Supple. There is no lymphadenopathy. There is no thyromegaly. THORAX: Reveals lungs that are clear, PA and lateral, without adventitious sounds. CARDIOVASCULAR: Demonstrated regular rate and rhythm. EXTREMITIES: Reveal no edema and is otherwise deferred.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThis is a return visit to the renal clinic for the patient with history as noted above. She has had variability in her glucose control, and the plan today is to continue her current regimen, which includes the following: Basal rate, 12 a.m. 0.6 units per hour, 4 a.m. 0.7 units per hour, and 9 a.m. 0.6 units per hour. Her target pre-meal is 120 and bedtime is 150. Her insulin/carbohydrate ratio is 10 and her correction factor is 60. We are not going to make any changes to her insulin pump settings at this time. I have encouraged her to watch the number of processed high-calorie foods that she is consuming late at night. She has agreed to try that and cut back on this a little bit. I want to get fasting labs to include her standard labs for us today but include a fasting C-peptide and a hemoglobin A1C, so that we can make arrangements for her to get an upgraded insulin pump. She states to me that she has been having some battery problems in the recent past, although she says the last time that she went four weeks without having to change batteries and that is about the appropriate amount of time. Nonetheless, she is out of warranty and we will try to get her a new pump.\nPlan to see the patient back here in approximately two months, and we will try to get the new pump through Medicare.\nKeywords:\nsoap / chart / progress notes, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, renal clinic, glucose control, blood sugar, insulin pump, insulin, kidney, peripheral, glucose,"}

He comes in today with his daughter. He has had no symptoms of CAD or CHF. He had followup with Dr. X and she thought he was doing quite well as well. He has had no symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. He has had no falls. His right knee does pain him at times and he is using occasional doses of Tylenol for that. He wonders whether he could use a knee brace to help him with that issue as well. His spirits are good. He has had no incontinence. His memory is clear, as is his thinking.\nMEDICATIONS:\n1. Bumex - 2 mg daily.\n2. Aspirin - 81 mg daily.\n3. Lisinopril - 40 mg daily.\n4. NPH insulin - 65 units in the morning and 25 units in the evening.\n5. Zocor - 80 mg daily.\n6. Toprol-XL - 200 mg daily.\n7. Protonix - 40 mg daily.\n8. Chondroitin/glucosamine - no longer using.\nMAJOR FINDINGS:\nWeight 240, blood pressure by nurse 160/80, by me 140/78, pulse 91 and regular, and O2 saturation 94%. He is afebrile. JVP is normal without HJR. CTAP. RRR. S1 and S2. Aortic murmur unchanged. Abdomen: Soft, NT without HSM, normal BS. Extremities: No edema on today's examination.

Bilateral OA changes of the knee.\nCreatinine 1.7, which was down from 2.3. A1c 7.6 down from 8.5. Total cholesterol 192, HDL 37, and triglycerides 487.\nASSESSMENTS:\n1. Congestive heart failure, stable on current regimen. Continue.\n2. Diabetes type II, A1c improved with increased doses of NPH insulin. Doing self-blood glucose monitoring with values in the morning between 100 and 130. Continue current regimen. Recheck A1c on return.\n3. Hyperlipidemia, at last visit, he had 3+ protein in his urine. TSH was normal. We will get a 24-hour urine to rule out nephrosis as the cause of his hypertriglyceridemia. In the interim, both Dr. X and I have been considering together as to whether the patient should have an agent added to treat his hypertriglyceridemia. Specifically we were considering TriCor (fenofibrate). Given his problems with high CPK values in the past for now, we have decided not to engage in that strategy. We will leave open for the future. Check fasting lipid panel today.\n4. Chronic renal insufficiency, improved with reduction in dose of Bumex over time.\n5. Arthritis, stable. I told the patient he could use Extra Strength Tylenol up to 4 grams a day, but I suggest that he start with a regular dose of 1 to 2 to 3 grams per day. He states he will inch that up slowly. With regard to a brace, he stated he used one in the past and that did not help very much. I worry a little bit about the tourniquet type effect of a brace that could increase his edema or put him at risk for venous thromboembolic disease. For now he will continue with his cane and walker.\n6.

Blood glucose records and food diaries are reviewed by the diabetes educator and the dietician. Fasting blood sugars are 127, 80, and 80. Two-hour postprandial breakfast reading was 105, two-hour postprandial lunch reading was 88, and two-hour postprandial dinner reading was 73 and 63. Her diet was excellent.\nSeven hours of counseling about diabetes mellitus was provided on this date.\nBlood glucose values obtained at 10 a.m. were 84 and at 2.30 p.m. were 109. Assessment of her knowledge is completed at the end of the counseling session. She demonstrated increased knowledge in all areas and had no further questions. She also completed an evaluation of the class.\nThe patient's feet were examined during the education session. She had flat feet bilaterally. Skin color was pink, temperature warm. Pedal pulses 2+. Her right second and third toes lay on each other. Also, the same on her left foot. However, there was no skin breakdown. She had large bunions, medial aspect of the ball of both feet. She had positive sensitivity to most areas of her feet, however, she had negative sensitivity to the medial and lateral aspect of the balls of her left foot.\nDuring the education session, she set behavioral goals for self care. First goal is to eat three meals a day and eat three snacks daily to improve her blood glucose levels. Second goal is to eat a well balanced meal at 1200 calories in order to lose one-half pound of weight per week and improve her blood glucose control. Third goal is to exercise by walking for 15 to 30 minutes a day, three to five days a week to increase her blood glucose control. Her success in achieving these goals will be followed in three months by a letter from the diabetes education class.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nSince she is doing so well with her diet changes, her blood sugars have been within normal limits and sometimes on the low side, especially considering the fact that she has low blood sugar unawareness.

He attributes this to an incident in which he was injured in 1994. I do not have any paperwork authenticating his claim that there is an open claim. Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05. He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity.\nHe took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10. He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum. He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time. His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994. The area of concern was L4-L5.\nThe patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1. There was no neural impingement. He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nFocal lower paralumbar pain, affecting both right and left sides, as well as intermittent right leg pain which appears to have improved significantly with the Medrol Dosepak. He denies any recent illness. He has no constitutional complaints such as fevers, chills or sweats. HEENT: The patient denies any cephalgia, ocular, nasopharyngeal symptoms. He has no dysphagia. Cardiovascular: He denies any palpitations, chest pain, syncope or near-syncope. Pulmonary: He denies any dyspnea or respiratory difficulties. GI: The patient has no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. GU: The patient denies any urinary frequency or dysuria. There is no gross hematuria. Dermatologic: The patient notes no new onset of rash or other dermatological abnormalities. Musculoskeletal: Denies any recent falls or near-falls. He denies any abnormalities of endocrine, immunologic, hematologic, organ systems.\nMEDICATIONS:\nAtenolol, Zestril, Vicodin.\nALLERGIES:\nNone.\nSOCIOECONOMIC STATUS:\nLifting limitations of 5 pounds and limited stooping, bending and twisting.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVital signs: Blood pressure 158/86, respiration 14, pulse 60, temperature 100.2. He is sitting upright, alert and oriented and in no acute distress. Skin is warm and dry. Gross neurologic examination is normal. ENT examination reveals normal oropharynx, nasopharynx, and tympanic membranes. Neck: Full range of motion with no adenopathy or thyromegaly. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear.\nOn examination of the lumbar spine, he is minimally tender to palpation. There is no overt muscular spasm. His range of motion is estimated at 40 degrees of flexion and 15 degrees of extension. Straight leg raises do not elicit any leg complaints on today's visit. Lower extremity reflexes are symmetric.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nLow back pain with a history of right leg pain. The leg pain is no longer present. His pain level has improved.\nPLAN:\n1. The patient will take another Medrol Dosepak.\n2. He can continue with physical therapy.\n3. He also continues with the same lifting restrictions.\n4.

The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen. It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months. It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again. Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large. The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg. The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back. These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her. She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress. She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility. It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head. She has lost strength in the left shoulder. As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count. In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up. She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three. She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March. She now weighs 284. Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable. She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much. She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath. She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much. Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen. I reviewed her lab work. Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.\nOBJECTIVE:\nGeneral: The patient is a very pleasant 44-year-old white female quite obese.\nVital Signs: Blood pressure: 122/70. Temperature: 98.6.\nHEENT: Head: Normocephalic. Ears: TMs intact. Eyes: Pupils round, and equal. Nose: Mucosa normal. Throat: Mucosa normal.\nLungs: Clear.\nHeart: Regular rate and rhythm.\nAbdomen: Soft and obese.\nExtremities: A lot of fluid in both legs, but especially the left leg is really swollen.

Multiple problems including left leg swelling.\n2. History of leukocytosis.\n3. Joint pain involving the left shoulder, probably impingement syndrome.\n4. Low back pain, chronic with obesity.\n5. Obesity.\n6. Frequency with urination.\n7. Tobacco abuse.\nPLAN:\n1. I will schedule for a venous Doppler of the left leg and will have her come back in the morning for a CBC and a metabolic panel.

Leg pain is no longer present.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThe patient is a 44-year-old man who was seen for complaints of low back and right thigh pain. He attributes this to an incident in which he was injured in 1994. I do not have any paperwork authenticating his claim that there is an open claim. Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05. He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity.\nHe took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10. He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum. He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time. His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994. The area of concern was L4-L5.\nThe patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1. There was no neural impingement. He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nFocal lower paralumbar pain, affecting both right and left sides, as well as intermittent right leg pain which appears to have improved significantly with the Medrol Dosepak. He denies any recent illness. He has no constitutional complaints such as fevers, chills or sweats. HEENT: The patient denies any cephalgia, ocular, nasopharyngeal symptoms. He has no dysphagia. Cardiovascular: He denies any palpitations, chest pain, syncope or near-syncope. Pulmonary: He denies any dyspnea or respiratory difficulties. GI: The patient has no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. GU: The patient denies any urinary frequency or dysuria. There is no gross hematuria. Dermatologic: The patient notes no new onset of rash or other dermatological abnormalities. Musculoskeletal: Denies any recent falls or near-falls. He denies any abnormalities of endocrine, immunologic, hematologic, organ systems.\nMEDICATIONS:\nAtenolol, Zestril, Vicodin.\nALLERGIES:\nNone.\nSOCIOECONOMIC STATUS:\nLifting limitations of 5 pounds and limited stooping, bending and twisting.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVital signs: Blood pressure 158/86, respiration 14, pulse 60, temperature 100.2. He is sitting upright, alert and oriented and in no acute distress. Skin is warm and dry. Gross neurologic examination is normal. ENT examination reveals normal oropharynx, nasopharynx, and tympanic membranes. Neck: Full range of motion with no adenopathy or thyromegaly. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear.\nOn examination of the lumbar spine, he is minimally tender to palpation. There is no overt muscular spasm. His range of motion is estimated at 40 degrees of flexion and 15 degrees of extension. Straight leg raises do not elicit any leg complaints on today's visit. Lower extremity reflexes are symmetric.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nLow back pain with a history of right leg pain. The leg pain is no longer present. His pain level has improved.\nPLAN:\n1. The patient will take another Medrol Dosepak.\n2. He can continue with physical therapy.\n3. He also continues with the same lifting restrictions.\n4. Follow up is within one week.\nKeywords:\nsoap / chart / progress notes, orthopedic, progress note, back, cephalgia, discectomy, lifting, myelogram, pain, pain level, physical therapy, restrictions, sacrum, thigh, medrol dosepak, medrol, dosepak,"}

She has noticed it since she has been on Lipitor. She has had some night sweats occasionally. She has had a little bit of fever and nausea. She has noticed her blood sugars have been low. She has lost over 30 pounds after exercising doing water aerobics at Genesis in Wichita. She has noticed her fasting blood sugars have been ranging from 100 to 120. Blood sugars one and a half hours after meals have been 185. She is coming in for a diabetic checkup in one month and wants lab prior to that time. She has been eating more meat recently and has not been on a diet for cholesterol.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\nInclude Lipitor 80 mg q.d. discontinued today, Vioxx 25 mg q.d., Maxzide 37/25 q.d., Protonix 40 mg q.d., hydroxyzine pamoate 50 mg at h.s., aspirin 81 mg q.d., Glucovance 1.25/250 b.i.d. decreased to one a day today, Monopril 20 mg q.d., estradiol one mg q.d., and glucosamine 1000 mg q.d.\nALLERGIES:\nCipro, sulfa, Bactrim, and Demerol.\nOBJECTIVE:\nVital Signs: Weight is 248 pounds which is a 12-pound drop from January. Blood pressure 120/70.

Straight leg lifts are normal.\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:\n1. Leg pain/bone pain, I am going to check her CMP. I think this possibly is a side effect from Lipitor. We will stop Lipitor, have her follow up in one month which she has already got planned for diabetes appointment and check symptoms at that time. Certainly if her pain improves might consider something like Crestor, which is more water soluble, which may cause less adverse effects. We will check her comprehensive metabolic panel to make sure the alkaline phosphatase is okay, may need an x-ray of back, hip, and legs at that time if symptoms are not gone.\n2. Hypercholesterolemia, this is somewhat bothersome as she is a diabetic. Did discuss with her that we need to stick to the diet especially after going off of Lipitor. We will see how she does with her bone pain/leg pain off of Lipitor. If she has improvement may consider Crestor in one month. I am going to check her lipid panel and a CMP. Apparently, she is going to get this at a different site, Mapleridge in Wichita.\n3. Type II diabetes. We will decrease her Glucovance because she is having frequent low blood sugars.

Joint inflammation is present due to an abnormal immune response in which the body attacks its own tissue. Specifically, the tissues lining the joint are involved as well as cartilage and muscle and sometimes the eyes and blood vessels. The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is obscure but it is associated with a family history, genetic and autoimmune problems, people ages 20-60, female gender 3:1 or a Native American background.\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:\n* Joint pain, swelling, redness, warmth. Commonly involved joints are the small joints of the hands and feet and the ankles, wrists, knees, shoulders and elbows.\n* Multiple swollen joints (more than 3) with simultaneous involvement of same joints on opposite side of the body.\n* Morning stiffness that lasts longer than 30 minutes.\n* Difficulty making a fist; poor grip strength.\n* Night pain.\n* Feeling \"sick\" - low fever, loss of appetite, tiredness, generalized aching and stiffness, weakness.\n* Rheumatoid nodules under the skin, usually along the surface of tendons or over bony prominences.\n* Disease may lead to deformed joints, decreased vision, anemia, muscle weakness, peripheral nerve problems, pericarditis, enlarged spleen, increased frequency of infections.\n* Blood tests will reveal a positive rheumatoid factor (RF) to be present the majority of the time.\nTREATMENT:\n* To diagnose RA, blood studies are done to detect a substance known as rheumatoid factor and x-rays may show typical findings.\n* Night splints for involved joints. Avoid putting a pillow under the knees as this will contribute to joint contracture.\n* Heat helps relieve the pain; hot water soaks, whirlpool baths, heat lamps, heating pads, etc. applied to affected joints 15-20 minutes 3 times per day is helpful.\n* Sleep on a firm mattress and sleep at least 10-12 hours per night. Get rest during the day; take naps.\n* Get bed rest during an active flare-up until symptoms subside.\n* Avoid humid weather if possible.\n* NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).\n* DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) - gold compounds, D-penicillamine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, antimalarials.\n* Immunosuppressive drugs.\n* Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief only when necessary.\n* Oral corticosteroids short term; corticosteroid injection into joint can temporarily relieve pain and inflammation.\n* Exercise as recommended by your physician. Exercise helps keep the joints limber and increases strength. Swimming and water activities are a good way to workout. Put all your joints through their full ranges of motion every day to prevent contractures. * Physical therapy may be recommended.\n* Surgical intervention.\n* Lose excess weight as being overweight will only stress the joints further.\n* Eat a normal, well-balanced diet.\nKeywords:\nrheumatology, ra, rheumatoid arthritis, joint inflammation, swollen joints, arthritis, joints, inflammation, corticosteroids, rheumatoid,"}

Use crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the foot, ankle, knee, or leg. Use splints for injuries of the hand, wrist, elbow, or arm. Continued exercise or activity could cause further injury, increased pain, or a delay in healing.\nICE:\nIce helps stop bleeding from injured blood vessels and capillaries. Sudden cold causes the small blood vessels to contract. This contraction decreases the amount of blood that can collect around the wound. The more blood that collects, the longer the healing time. Ice can be safely applied in many ways:\n* For injuries to small areas, such as a finger, toe, foot, or wrist, immerse the injured area for 15 to 35 minutes in a bucket of ice water. Use ice cubes to keep the water cold, adding more as the ice cubes dissolve.\n* For injuries to larger areas, use ice packs. Avoid placing the ice directly on the skin. Before applying the ice, place a towel, cloth, or one or two layers of an elasticized compression bandage on the skin to be iced. To make the ice pack, put ice chips or ice cubes in a plastic bag or wrap them in a thin towel. Place the ice pack over the cloth. The pack may sit directly on the injured part, or it may be wrapped in place.\n* Ice the injured area for about 30 minutes.\n* Remove the ice to allow the skin to warm for 15 minutes.\n* Reapply the ice.\n* Repeat the icing and warming cycles for 3 hours. Follow the instructions below for compression and elevation. If pain and swelling persist after 3 hours call our office. You may need to change the icing schedule after the first 3 hours. Regular ice treatment is often discontinued after 24 to 48 hours. At that point, heat is sometimes more comfortable.\nCOMPRESSION:\nCompression decreases swelling by slowing bleeding and limiting the accumulation of blood and plasma near the injured site. Without compression, fluid from adjacent normal tissue seeps into the injured area. To apply compression safely to an injury:\n* Use an elasticized bandage (Ace bandage) for compression, if possible. If you do not have one available, any kind of cloth will suffice for a short time.\n* Wrap the injured part firmly, wrapping over the ice. Begin wrapping below the injury site and extend above the injury site.\n* Be careful not to compress the area so tightly that the blood supply is impaired. Signs of deprivation of the blood supply include pain, numbness, cramping, and blue or dusky nails. Remove the compression bandage immediately if any of theses symptoms appears. Leave the bandage off until all signs of impaired circulation disappear. Then rewrap the area--less tightly this time.\nELEVATION:\nElevating the injured part above the level of the heart is another way to decrease swelling and pain at the injury site. Elevate the iced, compressed area in whatever way is most convenient. Prop an injured leg on a solid object or pillows. Elevate an injured arm by lying down and placing pillows under the arm or on the chest with the arm folded across.\nKeywords:\northopedic, rest, ice, compression, and elevation, foot, ankle, knee, leg, splints, hand, wrist, elbow, arm, ace bandage, compression and elevation, rice therapy, compression bandage, ice packs, rice, elevation, swelling, bandage, therapy,"}

He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm. It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time. He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm. It occurs on a daily basis. He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers. There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm.\nHe has had a 30-year history of neck pain. He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain. This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes. He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain. He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007. When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain. He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase. He is taking multiple other pain medications. The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nHe has had diabetes since 2003. He also has asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\nHe takes ACTOplus, albuterol, AndroGel, Astelin, Diovan, Dolgic Plus, aspirin 81 mg, fish oil, Lipitor, Lorazepam, multivitamins, Nasacort, Pulmicort, ranitidine, Singulair, Viagra, Zetia, Zyrtec, and Uroxatral. He also uses Lidoderm patches and multiple eye drops and creams.\nALLERGIES:\nHe states that Dyazide, Zithromax, and amoxicillin cause him to feel warm and itchy.\nFAMILY HISTORY:\nHis father died from breast cancer. He also had diabetes. He has a strong family history of diabetes. His mother is 89. He has a sister with diabetes. He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nHe lives alone. He works full time in Human Resources for the State of Maryland. He previously was an alcoholic, but quit in 1984. He also quit smoking cigarettes in 1984, after 16 years of smoking. He has a history of illicit drug use, but denies IV drug use. He denies any HIV risk factors and states that his last HIV test was over two years ago.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nHe has intermittent chest discomfort. He has chronic tinnitus. He has urinary dribbling. Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVital Signs: HR 72. RR 16.\nGeneral Appearance: Patient is well appearing, in no acute distress.\nCardiovascular: There is a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits.\nChest: The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nSkin: There are no rashes or lesions.\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:\nMental Status: Speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. The patient is alert and oriented to name, place, and date. Attention, concentration, registration, recall, and fund of knowledge are all intact.\nCranial Nerves: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Optic discs are normal. Visual fields are full. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. Facial sensation is normal. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness. Hearing is grossly intact. Shoulder shrug is full.\nMotor: There is normal muscle bulk and tone. There is no atrophy or fasciculations. There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.\nSensory: Sensation is intact to light touch, pinprick, temperature, vibratory sensation, and joint position sense. Romberg is absent.\nCoordination: There is no dysmetria or ataxia on finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.\nDeep Tendon Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas and ankles. Plantar reflexes are flexor. There are no finger flexors, Hoffman's sign, or jaw jerk.\nGait and Stance: Casual gait is normal. Heel, toe, and tandem walking are all normal.\nRADIOLOGIC DATA:\nMRI of the cervical spine, 05/19/08: I personally reviewed this film, which showed narrowing of the foramen on the right at C4-C5 and other degenerative changes without central stenosis.\nIMPRESSION:\nThe patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with one-year history of right arm pain. He also has a longstanding history of neck pain. His neurological examination is normal. He has an MRI that shows some degenerative changes. I do believe that his symptoms are probably referable to his neck. However, I do not think that they are severe enough for him to undergo surgery at this point in time. Perhaps another course of physical therapy may be helpful for him. I probably would not recommend anymore invasive procedure, such as a spinal stimulator, as this pain really is minimal. We could still try to treat him with neuropathic pain medications.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. I scheduled him to return for an EMG and nerve conduction studies to determine whether there is any evidence of nerve damage, although I think the likelihood is low.\n2. I gave him a prescription for Neurontin. I discussed the side effects of the medication with him.\n3. We can discuss his case tomorrow at Spine Conference to see if there are any further recommendations.\nKeywords:\nconsult - history and phy., arm pain, deep tendon reflexes, arm, mri, spine, neurological, nerves, reflexes, hand, sensation, fingers, neck,"}

It is usually located right under the breast bone. Physical and emotional stress, as well as eating heavy meals, can bring it on. In a healthy person, these stresses are easily handled. In a person with an underlying heart condition like coronary artery disease, heart valve problem, arrhythmias or high blood pressure, the heart doesn't get enough blood (i.e. not enough oxygen to the heart muscles). Other causes could be due to a hyperactive thyroid disorder or anemia. People more likely to have angina may also have diabetes mellitus, be overweight, smoke, have a poor diet with lots of salt and fat, fail to exercise, have a stressful workload or have a family history of coronary artery disease.\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:\n* Pain in chest described as tightness, heavy pressure, aching or squeezing.\n* The pain sometimes radiates to the jaw, left arm, teeth and/or outer ear.\n* Possibly a left-sided numbness, tingling, or pain in the arm, shoulder, elbow or chest.\n* Occasionally a sudden difficulty in breathing occurs.\n* Pain may be located between the shoulder blades.\nTREATMENT:\n* Nitroglycerin relieves the immediate symptoms of angina in seconds. Carry it with you at all times.\n* Other medications may be prescribed for the underlying heart problems. It is important to take them as prescribed by your doctor.\n* Surgery may be necessary to open the blocked coronary arteries (balloon angioplasty) or to bypass them.\n* Correct the contributing factors you have control over. Lose weight, don't smoke, eat a low-salt, low-fat diet and avoid physical and emotional stresses that cause angina. Such stressors include anger, overworking, going between extremes in hot and cold, sudden physical exertion and high altitudes (pressurized airplanes aren't a risk). Practice relaxation techniques.\n* Exercise! Discuss first what you are able to do with your doctor and then go do it.\n* Even with treatment, angina may result in a heart attack, congestive heart failure or a fatal abnormal heartbeat. Treatment decreases the odds that these will occur.\n* Let your doctor know if your angina doesn't go away after 10 minutes, even when you have taken a nitroglycerin tablet. Call if you have repeated chest pains that awaken you from sleep regardless if the nitroglycerin helps. If your pain changes or feels different, call your doctor or call 911 if the pain is severe.\nKeywords:\ncardiovascular / pulmonary, lack of oxygen, heart valve, arrhythmias, blood pressure, heart, tightness, nitroglycerin, coronary artery disease, oxygen, angina, coronary, chest,"}

It occurs on a daily basis. He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers. There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThe patient is a 58-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right arm pain. He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm. It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time. He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm. It occurs on a daily basis. He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers. There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm.\nHe has had a 30-year history of neck pain. He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain. This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes. He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain. He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007. When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain. He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase. He is taking multiple other pain medications. The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nHe has had diabetes since 2003. He also has asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\nHe takes ACTOplus, albuterol, AndroGel, Astelin, Diovan, Dolgic Plus, aspirin 81 mg, fish oil, Lipitor, Lorazepam, multivitamins, Nasacort, Pulmicort, ranitidine, Singulair, Viagra, Zetia, Zyrtec, and Uroxatral. He also uses Lidoderm patches and multiple eye drops and creams.\nALLERGIES:\nHe states that Dyazide, Zithromax, and amoxicillin cause him to feel warm and itchy.\nFAMILY HISTORY:\nHis father died from breast cancer. He also had diabetes. He has a strong family history of diabetes. His mother is 89. He has a sister with diabetes. He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nHe lives alone. He works full time in Human Resources for the State of Maryland. He previously was an alcoholic, but quit in 1984. He also quit smoking cigarettes in 1984, after 16 years of smoking. He has a history of illicit drug use, but denies IV drug use. He denies any HIV risk factors and states that his last HIV test was over two years ago.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nHe has intermittent chest discomfort. He has chronic tinnitus. He has urinary dribbling. Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVital Signs: HR 72. RR 16.\nGeneral Appearance: Patient is well appearing, in no acute distress.\nCardiovascular: There is a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits.\nChest: The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nSkin: There are no rashes or lesions.\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:\nMental Status: Speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. The patient is alert and oriented to name, place, and date. Attention, concentration, registration, recall, and fund of knowledge are all intact.\nCranial Nerves: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Optic discs are normal. Visual fields are full. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. Facial sensation is normal. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness. Hearing is grossly intact. Shoulder shrug is full.\nMotor: There is normal muscle bulk and tone. There is no atrophy or fasciculations. There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.\nSensory: Sensation is intact to light touch, pinprick, temperature, vibratory sensation, and joint position sense. Romberg is absent.\nCoordination: There is no dysmetria or ataxia on finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.\nDeep Tendon Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas and ankles. Plantar reflexes are flexor. There are no finger flexors, Hoffman's sign, or jaw jerk.\nGait and Stance: Casual gait is normal. Heel, toe, and tandem walking are all normal.\nRADIOLOGIC DATA:\nMRI of the cervical spine, 05/19/08: I personally reviewed this film, which showed narrowing of the foramen on the right at C4-C5 and other degenerative changes without central stenosis.\nIMPRESSION:\nThe patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with one-year history of right arm pain. He also has a longstanding history of neck pain. His neurological examination is normal. He has an MRI that shows some degenerative changes. I do believe that his symptoms are probably referable to his neck. However, I do not think that they are severe enough for him to undergo surgery at this point in time. Perhaps another course of physical therapy may be helpful for him. I probably would not recommend anymore invasive procedure, such as a spinal stimulator, as this pain really is minimal. We could still try to treat him with neuropathic pain medications.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. I scheduled him to return for an EMG and nerve conduction studies to determine whether there is any evidence of nerve damage, although I think the likelihood is low.\n2. I gave him a prescription for Neurontin. I discussed the side effects of the medication with him.\n3. We can discuss his case tomorrow at Spine Conference to see if there are any further recommendations.\nKeywords:\nneurology, arm pain, deep tendon reflexes, arm, mri, spine, neurological, nerves, reflexes, hand, sensation, fingers, neck,"}

The vast majority of women who develop pre-eclampsia are pregnant with their first child and are towards the end of their child-bearing years. There are identifiable risk factors for developing pre-eclampsia: family history of pre-eclampsia, previous pregnancy with pre-eclampsia, multiple gestation, and a hydatiform mole (an intrauterine growth that mimics pregnancy). A chronic high blood pressure and underlying blood vessel disease increases the risk. Pre-eclampsia ranges from mild to severe to eclampsia as the end-stage. Untreated pre-eclampsia can result in a stroke, fluid-build up around the lungs, kidney failure, death of baby and death of mother.\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:\nMILD PRE-ECLAMPSIA:\n* Significant blood pressure increase even if you are still within the normal blood pressure limits.\n* Swelling in the face, hands and feet which worsens in the a.m.\n* Gaining more than a pound a week, especially in the last trimester.\n* Routine prenatal checkup reveals protein in the urine.\n* Seizures are possible.\nSEVERE PRE-ECLAMPSIA:\n* More blood pressure increase.\n* Further swelling in face, hands and feet.\n* Visual disturbances.\n* Headache.\n* Irritability.\n* Abdominal pain.\n* Tiredness.\n* Decreased urination.\n* Seizures possible.\n* Nausea and vomiting.\nECLAMPSIA:\n* Symptoms worsen.\n* Seizures.\n* Muscle twitches.\n* Coma.\nTREATMENT:\n* Diagnosis - blood tests, urinalysis, blood pressure monitoring.\n* Mild preeclampsia can be treated at home. Severe symptoms require hospitalization and possible early delivery of the baby, often by cesarean section.\n* Daily weighing.\n* Daily monitoring for protein in urine.\n* Medications to lower blood pressure if preeclampsia is severe.\n* Magnesium sulfate or other anti-seizure drugs may be necessary to prevent seizures.\n* Get lots of rest! Lay on your left side to help circulation.\n* Follow any dietary advice given by your doctor.\n* Get regular prenatal checkups! Eat a nutritious diet and take your vitamin supplements.\n* Never take any medications that are not prescribed or recommended by your physician.\n* Call the office if your headaches become severe, you have visual disturbances or if you gain more than 3 pounds in 24 hours.\nRESTRICTING CAFFEINE:\nYou should reduce your intake of caffeine by cutting back on coffee and other caffeinated beverages like soda. In addition, you should avoid chocolate that also contains caffeine.\nRESTRICTING SALT:\nYou are to restrict your salt intake by reducing or eliminating table salt from your meals and avoiding foods that are high in salt concentration. For more information about which foods are high in salt, read the label of any foods you intend to consume and look for sodium content.\nKeywords:\nobstetrics / gynecology, central nervous system, intrauterine growth, pre eclampsia, blood pressure, pregnancy, preeclampsia, eclampsia,"}

He has been off on insurance for over a year. Has been using NPH and Regular insulin to maintain his blood sugars. States that he is deathly afraid of having a low blood sugar due to motor vehicle accident he was in several years ago. Reports that his blood sugar dropped too low which caused the accident. Since this point in time, he has been unwilling to let his blood sugars fall within a normal range, for fear of hypoglycemia. Also reports that he regulates his blood sugars with how he feels, rarely checking his blood sugar with a glucometer.\nReports that he has been worked up extensively at hospital and was seeing an Endocrinologist at one time. Reports that he had some indications of kidney damage when first diagnosed. His urine microalbumin today is 100. His last hemoglobin A1C drawn at the end of December is 11.9. Reports that at one point, he was on Lantus which worked well and he did not worry about his blood sugars dropping too low. While using Lantus, he was able to get his hemoglobin A1C down to 7. His last CMP shows an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of 168. He denies alcohol or drug use and is a non smoker. Reports he quit drinking 3 years ago. I have discussed with patient that it would be appropriate to do an SGGT and hepatic panel today. Patient also has a history of gastroparesis and impotence. Patient requests Nexium and Viagra, neither of which are covered under the Health Plan.\nPatient reports that he was in a scooter accident one week ago, fell off his scooter, hit his head. Was not wearing a helmet. Reports that he did not go to the emergency room and had a headache for several days after this incident. Reports that an ambulance arrived at the scene and he was told he had a scalp laceration and to go into the emergency room. Patient did not comply. Reports that the headache has resolved. Denies any dizziness, nausea, vomiting, or other neurological abnormalities.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nWD, WN. Slender, 34-year-old white male. VITAL SIGNS: Blood sugar 145, blood pressure 120/88, heart rate 104, respirations 16. Microalbumin 100.

Appears to be healing well. HEENT: Normocephalic. PERRLA. EOMI. TMs pearly gray with landmarks present. Nares patent. Throat with no redness or swelling. Nontender sinuses. NECK: Supple. Full ROM. No LAD. CARDIAC: RRR. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. RESPIRATORY: CTA. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender. No HSM and no masses. NEURO: Significant for lower extremity numbness throughout. Microfilament test shows more than 3 regions without sensation bilaterally. Bottoms of feet appear calloused and dry. Skin is intact. There is also a small contusion on right shin which appears to be healing, less than 1/2 inch in length and 1 cm in diameter. No signs of infection at this time and appears to be healing. Cranial nerves 2-12 grossly nonfocal. Cerebellar function intact demonstrated through RAM.\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Diabetes mellitus, type 1, poorly controlled.\n2. Significant diabetic neuropathy with positive microalbuminuria.\n3. Scalp laceration, secondary to motor vehicle accident, symptoms resolving.\n4. Elevated Alk Phos, etiology unclear.\nPLAN:\n1. Diabetes mellitus type 1: We will follow up the elevated alkaline phosphatase with an SGGT and a hepatic function panel. The positive microalbumin is 100 today. He will be placed on a low dose Ace Inhibitor. I will put in a Prior Authorization for Lantus. I have also asked the patient to keep a log of his blood sugars for 2 weeks. Patient agrees to this. We may need to put in a referral to Endocrinology to get him stabilized. Prescription given for Prilosec OTC for GERD symptoms.\n2. Followup scooter accident. Lacerations on scalp and shin appear to be healing. Discussed with patient if there are any signs of heat, swelling, infection to return to clinic. It is extremely important for him to watch these areas as he does not have feeling in the majority of his lower body.\nKeywords:\nsoap / chart / progress notes, diabetes mellitus, nph, regular insulin, sggt, diabetic neuropathy, dizziness, followup, glucometer, hypoglycemia, microalbumin, nausea, neurological, vomiting, mellitus type, blood sugars, blood, diabetes, mellitus, sugars,"}

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine was also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications.\nKeywords:\nsurgery, trabeculectomy, kelly-descemet punch, maxitrol ointment, open angle glaucoma, tg needle, bleeding, corneal edema, corneal hemorrhage hypotony, diplopia, elevated pressure, glaucoma, infection, iridectomy, loss of the eye, loss of vision, mitomycin c, ptosis, reoperation, retinal detachment, temporal paracentesis, worsening of glaucoma, balanced salt solution, anterior chamber, scleral flap, eye, angle, mitomycin, conjunctival, chamber, flap,"}

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine was also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications.\nKeywords:\nophthalmology, trabeculectomy, kelly-descemet punch, maxitrol ointment, open angle glaucoma, tg needle, bleeding, corneal edema, corneal hemorrhage hypotony, diplopia, elevated pressure, glaucoma, infection, iridectomy, loss of the eye, loss of vision, mitomycin c, ptosis, reoperation, retinal detachment, temporal paracentesis, worsening of glaucoma, balanced salt solution, anterior chamber, scleral flap, eye, angle, mitomycin, conjunctival, chamber, flap,"}

Right hemicolectomy.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nThe patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia. She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia. Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted. Noncontrast CT of the head was negative. Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d. Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour. Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings. While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times. She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course. There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.\nAt discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted. It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. The insulin was to be NovoLog. Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools. A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure. General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour. Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis. Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well. Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness. The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist. The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site. At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours. The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site. It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim. Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable. She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol. Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night. The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS:\nThe patient was discharged to home. She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.

Baby was born at ABCD Hospital at 1333 on 07/14/2006. Mother is a 20-year-old gravida 1, para 0 female who received prenatal care. Prenatal course was complicated by low amniotic fluid index and hypertension. She was evaluated for evolving preeclampsia and had a C-section secondary to the nonreassuring fetal status. Baby delivered operatively, Apgar scores were 8 and 9 initially taken to level 2 satellite nursery and arrangements were to transfer to Children's Hospital. Infant was transferred to Children's Hospital for higher level of care, stayed at Children's Hospital for approximately 2 weeks, and was transferred back to ABCD where he stayed until he was discharged on 08/16/2006.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nAt the time of transfer to ABCD, these were the following issues.\nFEEDING AND NUTRITION:\nBaby was on TPN and p.o. feeds had been started and were advanced 1 ml q.6h. Baby was tolerating p.o. feeds of expressed breast milk and baby began to experience some abdominal distention. The p.o. feeds were held and IV D10 water was given. Baby was started on Mylicon drops and glycerin suppositories. Abdominal ultrasound showed gaseous distention without signs of obstruction. OG tube was passed. Baby improved after couple of days when p.o. feedings were restarted. Baby was also given Reglan. At the time of discharge, baby was tolerating p.o. feeds well of BM fortified with 22-cal NeoSure.

Once the eye was dilated, the patient was wheeled to the operating suite.\nInside the operating suite, central monitoring lines were established. Through the peripheral IV, the patient received intravenous sedation consisting of Propofol and once somnolent from this, retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2 cc's of 2% Xylocaine plain with 150 units of Wydase. The block was administered in a retrobulbar fashion using an Atkinson needle and a good block was obtained. Digital pressure was applied for approximately five minutes.\nThe patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for ophthalmological surgery. A Betadine prep was carried out of the face, lids, and eye. During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes. A wire lid speculum was inserted to maintain patency of the lids. With benefit of the operating microscope, a diamond blade was used to place a groove temporally. A paracentesis wound was also placed temporally using the same blade. Viscoelastic was then instilled into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis site and a 2.8 mm. diamond keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber through the previously placed groove. The cystotome was then inserted into the eye and circular capsulorhexis was performed without difficulty. The capsular remnant was withdrawn from the eye using long angled McPherson forceps. Balanced salt solution with a blunt cannula was then inserted into the eye and hydrodissection was performed. The lens was noted to rotate freely within the capsular bag. The phaco instrument was then inserted into the eye using the Kelman tip. The lens nucleus was grooved and broken into two halves. One of the halves was in turn broken into quarters. Each of the quarters was removed from the eye using the memory 2 settings and phacoemulsification. Attention was then turned toward the remaining half of the nucleus and this, in turn, was removed as well, with the splitting maneuver. Once the nucleus had been removed from the eye, the irrigating and aspirating tip was inserted and the cortical material was stripped out in sections. Once the cortical material had been completely removed, a diamond dusted cannula was inserted into the eye and the posterior capsule was polished. Viscoelastic was again instilled into the capsular bag as well as the anterior chamber. The wound was enlarged slightly using the diamond keratome. The above described intraocular lens was folded outside the eye using a mustache fold and inserted using folding forceps. Once inside the eye, the lens was unfolded into the capsular bag in a single maneuver. It was noted to be centered nicely. The viscoelastic was then withdrawn from the eye using the irrigating and aspirating tip of the phaco machine.\nNext, Miostat was instilled into the operative eye and the wound was checked for water tightness. It was found to be such. After removing the drapes and speculum, TobraDex drops were instilled into the operative eye and a gauze patch and Fox protective shield were placed over the eye.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure extremely well and was taken to the recovery area in good condition.

Informed consent was obtained. On the day of surgery, (s)he received several sets of drops in the XXX eye including 2.5% phenylephrine, 1% Mydriacyl, 1% Cyclogyl, Ocuflox and Acular. (S)he was taken to the operating room and sedated via IV sedation. 2% lidocaine jelly was placed in the XXX eye (or, retrobulbar anesthesia was performed using a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% marcaine). The XXX eye was prepped using a 10% Betadine solution. (S)he was covered in sterile drapes leaving only the XXX eye exposed. A Lieberman lid speculum was placed to provide exposure. The Thornton fixation ring and a Superblade were used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 (or 11 depending upon side and handedness, and assuming superior incision) o'clock. Then 1% lidocaine was injected through the paracentesis. After the nonpreserved lidocaine was injected, Viscoat was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The Thornton fixation ring and a 2.75 mm keratome blade were used to create a two-step full-thickness clear corneal incision superiorly. The cystitome and Utrata forceps were used to create a continuous capsulorrhexis in the anterior lens capsule. BSS on a hydrodissection cannula was used to perform gentle hydrodissection. Phacoemulsification was then performed to remove the nucleus. I & A was performed to remove the remaining cortical material. Provisc was injected to fill the capsular bag and anterior chamber. A XXX diopter SN60AT (for Acrysof natural lens) intraocular lens was injected into the capsular bag. The Kuglen hook was used to rotate it into proper position in the capsular bag. I & A was performed to remove the remaining Viscoelastic material from the eye. BSS on the 30-gauge cannula was used to hydrate the wound. The wounds were checked and found to be watertight. The lid speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Several drops of Ocuflox were placed in the XXX eye. The eye was covered with an eye shield. The patient was taken to the recovery area in a good condition. There were no complications.\nKeywords:\nsurgery, phacoemulsification, acrysof, acrysof natural lens, acular, kuglen hook, ocuflox, provisc, sn60at, senile cataract, thornton fixation ring, bleeding, capsular bag, decreased vision, diopters, diplopia, infection, loss of the eye, loss of vision, ptosis, retinal detachment, lid speculum, thornton fixation, anterior chamber, intraocular lens, intraocular, chamber, lidocaine,"}

It usually occurs from the 20th week of pregnancy to 7 days postpartum. The cause is unknown. It is also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension or toxemia of pregnancy.\nECLAMPSIA\nis the end-stage of the pre-eclampsia process. The vast majority of women who develop pre-eclampsia are pregnant with their first child and are towards the end of their child-bearing years. There are identifiable risk factors for developing pre-eclampsia: family history of pre-eclampsia, previous pregnancy with pre-eclampsia, multiple gestation, and a hydatiform mole (an intrauterine growth that mimics pregnancy). A chronic high blood pressure and underlying blood vessel disease increases the risk. Pre-eclampsia ranges from mild to severe to eclampsia as the end-stage. Untreated pre-eclampsia can result in a stroke, fluid-build up around the lungs, kidney failure, death of baby and death of mother.\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:\nMILD PRE-ECLAMPSIA:\n* Significant blood pressure increase even if you are still within the normal blood pressure limits.\n* Swelling in the face, hands and feet which worsens in the a.m.\n* Gaining more than a pound a week, especially in the last trimester.\n* Routine prenatal checkup reveals protein in the urine.\n* Seizures are possible.\nSEVERE PRE-ECLAMPSIA:\n* More blood pressure increase.\n* Further swelling in face, hands and feet.\n* Visual disturbances.\n* Headache.\n* Irritability.\n* Abdominal pain.\n* Tiredness.\n* Decreased urination.\n* Seizures possible.\n* Nausea and vomiting.\nECLAMPSIA:\n* Symptoms worsen.\n* Seizures.\n* Muscle twitches.\n* Coma.\nTREATMENT:\n* Diagnosis - blood tests, urinalysis, blood pressure monitoring.\n* Mild preeclampsia can be treated at home. Severe symptoms require hospitalization and possible early delivery of the baby, often by cesarean section.\n* Daily weighing.\n* Daily monitoring for protein in urine.\n* Medications to lower blood pressure if preeclampsia is severe.\n* Magnesium sulfate or other anti-seizure drugs may be necessary to prevent seizures.\n* Get lots of rest! Lay on your left side to help circulation.\n* Follow any dietary advice given by your doctor.\n* Get regular prenatal checkups! Eat a nutritious diet and take your vitamin supplements.\n* Never take any medications that are not prescribed or recommended by your physician.\n* Call the office if your headaches become severe, you have visual disturbances or if you gain more than 3 pounds in 24 hours.\nRESTRICTING CAFFEINE:\nYou should reduce your intake of caffeine by cutting back on coffee and other caffeinated beverages like soda. In addition, you should avoid chocolate that also contains caffeine.\nRESTRICTING SALT:\nYou are to restrict your salt intake by reducing or eliminating table salt from your meals and avoiding foods that are high in salt concentration. For more information about which foods are high in salt, read the label of any foods you intend to consume and look for sodium content.\nKeywords:\nobstetrics / gynecology, central nervous system, intrauterine growth, pre eclampsia, blood pressure, pregnancy, preeclampsia, eclampsia,"}

History is taken mostly from the emergency room record. The patient is unable to give any history and no family member is present for questioning. When asked why he came to the emergency room, the patient replies that it started about 2 PM yesterday. However, he is unable to tell me exactly what started at 2 PM yesterday. The patient's speech is clear, but he speaks nonsensically using words in combinations that don't make any sense. No other history of present illness is available.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nPer the emergency room record, significant for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\nUnknown.\nFAMILY HISTORY:\nUnknown.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nThe patient denies smoking and drinking.\nMEDICATIONS:\nPer the emergency room record, medications are Lotensin 20 mg daily, Toprol 50 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily and aspirin 81 mg daily.\nALLERGIES:\nUNKNOWN.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nUnobtainable secondary to the patient's condition.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS: Temperature: 97.9. Pulse: 79. Respiratory rate: 20. Blood pressure: 117/84.\nGENERAL: Well-developed, well-nourished male in no acute distress.\nHEENT: Eyes: Pupils are equal, round and reactive. There is no scleral icterus. Ears, nose and throat: His oropharynx is moist. His hearing is normal.\nNECK: No JVD. No thyromegaly.\nCARDIOVASCULAR: Irregular rhythm. No lower extremity edema.\nRESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with normal effort.\nABDOMEN: Nontender. Nondistended. Bowel sounds are positive.\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no clubbing of the digits. The patient's strength is 5/5 throughout.\nNEUROLOGICAL: Babinski's are downgoing bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ throughout.\nLABORATORY DATA:\nBy report, head CT from the outlying facility was negative. An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 75. There is no indication of any acute cardiac ischemia. A chest x-ray shows no acute pulmonary process, but does show cardiomegaly.\nLabs are as follows: White count 9.4, hemoglobin 17.2, hematocrit 52.5, platelet count 219. PTT 24, PT 13, INR 0.96. Sodium 135, potassium 3.6, chloride 99, bicarb 27, BUN 13, creatinine 1.4, glucose 161, calcium 9, magnesium 1.9, total protein 7, albumin 3.7, AST 22, ALT 41, alkaline phosphatase 85, total bilirubin 0.7, total cholesterol 193. Cardiac isoenzymes are negative times one with a troponin of 0.09.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Probable stroke. The patient has an expressive aphasia. He does not have dysarthria, however. Also, his strength is not affected. I suspect that the patient has had strokes or TIAs in the past because he was taking aspirin and Plavix at home. Head CT is reportedly negative. I will ask our radiologist to re-read the head CT. I will also order MRI and MRA, carotid Doppler ultrasound and echocardiogram in addition to a fasting lipid profile. I will consult neurology to evaluate and continue his aspirin and Plavix.\n2. Atrial fibrillation. The patient's rate is controlled currently. I will continue him on his amiodarone 200 mg twice daily and consult CHI to evaluate him.\n3. Hypertension. I will continue his home medications and add clonidine as needed.\n4. Hyperlipidemia. The patient takes no medications for this currently. I will check a fasting lipid profile.\n5. Hyperglycemia. It is unknown whether the patient has a history of diabetes. His glucose is currently 171. I will start him on sliding scale insulin for now and monitor closely.\n6. Renal insufficiency. It is also unknown whether the patient has a history of this and what his baseline creatinine might be. Currently he has only mild renal insufficiency. This does not appear to be prerenal. Will monitor for now.\nKeywords:\ngeneral medicine, altered mental status, stroke, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, fasting lipid profile, fasting lipid, lipid profile, renal insufficiency, head ct, illness, insufficiency,"}

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine was also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications.\nKeywords:\nsurgery, trabeculectomy, kelly-descemet punch, maxitrol ointment, open angle glaucoma, tg needle, bleeding, corneal edema, corneal hemorrhage hypotony, diplopia, elevated pressure, glaucoma, infection, iridectomy, loss of the eye, loss of vision, mitomycin c, ptosis, reoperation, retinal detachment, temporal paracentesis, worsening of glaucoma, balanced salt solution, anterior chamber, scleral flap, eye, angle, mitomycin, conjunctival, chamber, flap,"}

When a person has a heart failure (such as MI), BNP is secreted so immensely that it sits well above the measurable range.

The patient received 3 nebulizers at home without much improvement. He was subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to BiPAP.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nThe patient was admitted to the hospitalist service, treated with frequent small volume nebulizers, treated with IV Solu-Medrol and BiPAP support for COPD exacerbation. The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100s to mid 100s. The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin. The patient subsequently responded well as well received IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Zosyn. The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization. The patient subsequently was able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed. The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing BiPAP, was simply using supplemental O2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturations on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula. The patient was able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and was able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet. Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow was thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time. The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions that appeared to be unchanged. There was also more pronounced patchy alveolar opacity, which appeared to be, \"mass like\" in the right suprahilar region. This subsequently resolved and the patient's infiltrate slowly improved over the course of his hospitalization. On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a chest x-ray 2 views, which allowing for differences in technique revealed little change in the bibasilar infiltrates and atelectatic changes at the bases bilaterally. This was compared with an examination performed 3 days prior. The patient also had minimal bilateral effusions. The patient will continue with clindamycin for the next 2 weeks after discharge. Home health has been ordered and the case has been discussed in detail with Shaun Eagan, physician assistant at Eureka Community Health Center. The patient was discharged as well on a dysphagia 2 diet, thin liquids are okay. The patient discharged on the following medications.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.

The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100s to mid 100s. The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin. The patient subsequently responded well as well received IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Zosyn. The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization. The patient subsequently was able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed. The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing BiPAP, was simply using supplemental O2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturations on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula. The patient was able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and was able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet. Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow was thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time. The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions that appeared to be unchanged. There was also more pronounced patchy alveolar opacity, which appeared to be, \"mass like\" in the right suprahilar region. This subsequently resolved and the patient's infiltrate slowly improved over the course of his hospitalization. On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a chest x-ray 2 views, which allowing for differences in technique revealed little change in the bibasilar infiltrates and atelectatic changes at the bases bilaterally. This was compared with an examination performed 3 days prior. The patient also had minimal bilateral effusions. The patient will continue with clindamycin for the next 2 weeks after discharge. Home health has been ordered and the case has been discussed in detail with Shaun Eagan, physician assistant at Eureka Community Health Center. The patient was discharged as well on a dysphagia 2 diet, thin liquids are okay. The patient discharged on the following medications.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Home oxygen 1 to 2 liters to maintain O2 saturations at 89 to 91% at all times.\n2. Ativan 1 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n3. Metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n4. Glucotrol 5 mg p.o. daily.\n5.

Both conditions may lead to sleep fragmentation and/or intermittent oxygen desaturation, both of which have significant health implications including poor sleep quality and stress on the cardiovascular system. Symptoms like daytime somnolence, fatigue, hyperactivity, behavior difficulty (i.e., ADHD) and decreased school performance have been reported with these conditions. In addition, the most severe cases may be associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary and/or systemic hypertension and even cor pulmonale.\nIn this patient, the risks for a sleep-disordered breathing include obesity and the tonsillar hypertrophy.

A CT scan of his abdomen showed evidence of appendicitis with perforation. He was evaluated in the Emergency Department and placed on the appendicitis critical pathway for this acute appendicitis process. He required several boluses of fluid for tachycardia and evidence of dehydration.\nI met with Carlos' parents and talked to them about the diagnosis of appendicis and surgical risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options. All their questions have been answered and they agree with the surgical plan.\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS:\nThe patient had acute perforated appendicitis with diffuse suppurative peritonitis including multiple intraloop abscesses and purulent debris in all quadrants of the abdomen including the perihepatic and subphrenic recesses as well.\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nThe patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia. A Foley catheter was placed for decompression, and his abdomen was prepared and draped in a standard fashion. A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated in the soft tissues around his umbilicus and in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant locations chosen for trocar insertion. We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy as the procedure. A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision was made and an open technique was used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia. CO2 was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working ports were placed in areas that had been previously anesthetized.\nThere was a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesions between the omentum and adjacent surfaces of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum. After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix. In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix. The base of the appendix was then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix was amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port. I spent the next 10 minutes irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system. When this was complete, the CO2 was released one final time and as much of the fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity as possible. The umbilical fascia was closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incisions were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips. The patient tolerated the operation well. He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. His blood loss was less than 10 mL, and he received only crystalloid fluid during the procedure.\nKeywords:\ngastroenterology, adhesions, peritoneum, purulent debris, umbilical fascia, peritoneal cavity, laparoscopic appendectomy, appendectomy, constipation, purulent, debris, umbilical, appendix, abdomen, laparoscopic, perforation, appendicitis,"}

On evaluation, it was noted that the patient has clinical findings consistent with acute appendicitis. However, the patient with additional history of loose stools for several days prior to event. Therefore, a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained revealing findings consistent with acute appendicitis. There was no evidence of colitis on the CAT scan. With this in mind and the patient's continued pain at present, the patient was explained the risks and benefits of appendectomy. She agreed to procedure and informed consent was obtained.\nGROSS FINDINGS:\nThe appendix was removed without difficulty with laparoscopic approach. The appendix itself noted to have a significant inflammation about it. There was no evidence of perforation of the appendix.\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nThe patient was placed in supine position. After appropriate anesthesia was obtained and sterile prep and drape completed, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a curvilinear infraumbilical incision. Through this incision, a Veress needle was utilized to create a CO2 pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg. The Veress needle was then removed. A 10 mm trocar was then introduced through this incision into the abdomen. A video laparoscope was then inserted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated upon evaluation. Initially, bilateral ovarian cysts were appreciated, however, there was no evidence of acute disease on evaluation. Photodocumentation was obtained.\nA 5 mm port was then placed in the right upper quadrant. This was done under direct visualization and a blunt grasper was utilized to mobilize the appendix. Next, a 12 mm port was placed in the left lower quadrant lateral to the rectus musculature under direct visualization. Through this port, the dissector was utilized to create a small window in the mesoappendix. Next, an EndoGIA with GI staples was utilized to fire across the base of the appendix, which was done noting it to be at the base of the appendix. Next, staples were changed to vascular staples and the mesoappendix was then cut and vessels were then ligated with vascular staples. Two 6 X-loupe wires with EndoGIA were utilized in this prior portion of the procedure. Next, an EndoCatch was placed through the 12 mm port and the appendix was placed within it. The appendix was then removed from the 12 mm port site and taken off the surgical site. The 12 mm port was then placed back into the abdomen and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was recreated. The base of the appendix was reevaluated and noted to be hemostatic. Aspiration of warm saline irrigant then done and noted to be clear. There was a small adhesion appreciated in the region of the surgical site. This was taken down with blunt dissection without difficulty. There was no evidence of other areas of disease. Upon re-exploration with a video laparoscope in the abdomen and after this noting the appendix base to be hemostatic and intact. The instruments were removed from the patient and the port sites were then taken off under direct visualization. The CO2 pneumoperitoneum was released into the air and the fascia was approximated in the 10 mm and 12 mm port sites with #0 Vicryl ligature x2. Marcaine 0.25% was then utilized in all three incision sites and #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate the skin and all three incision sites. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and taken to Postoperative Care Unit in stable condition and monitored under General Medical Floor on IV antibiotics, pain medications, and return to diet.\nKeywords:\nsurgery, abdomen, pelvis, laparoscopic appendectomy, suppurative appendicitis, veress needle, acute appendicitis, appendix, appendectomy, pneumoperitoneum, laparoscopic, appendicitis,"}

We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy as the procedure. A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision was made and an open technique was used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia. CO2 was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working ports were placed in areas that had been previously anesthetized.\nThere was a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesions between the omentum and adjacent surfaces of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum. After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix. In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix. The base of the appendix was then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix was amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port. I spent the next 10 minutes irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system. When this was complete, the CO2 was released one final time and as much of the fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity as possible. The umbilical fascia was closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incisions were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips. The patient tolerated the operation well. He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. His blood loss was less than 10 mL, and he received only crystalloid fluid during the procedure.\nKeywords:\nsurgery, adhesions, peritoneum, purulent debris, umbilical fascia, peritoneal cavity, laparoscopic appendectomy, appendectomy, constipation, purulent, debris, umbilical, appendix, abdomen, laparoscopic, perforation, appendicitis,"}

On evaluation, it was noted that the patient has clinical findings consistent with acute appendicitis. However, the patient with additional history of loose stools for several days prior to event. Therefore, a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained revealing findings consistent with acute appendicitis. There was no evidence of colitis on the CAT scan. With this in mind and the patient's continued pain at present, the patient was explained the risks and benefits of appendectomy. She agreed to procedure and informed consent was obtained.\nGROSS FINDINGS:\nThe appendix was removed without difficulty with laparoscopic approach. The appendix itself noted to have a significant inflammation about it. There was no evidence of perforation of the appendix.\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nThe patient was placed in supine position. After appropriate anesthesia was obtained and sterile prep and drape completed, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a curvilinear infraumbilical incision. Through this incision, a Veress needle was utilized to create a CO2 pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg. The Veress needle was then removed. A 10 mm trocar was then introduced through this incision into the abdomen. A video laparoscope was then inserted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated upon evaluation. Initially, bilateral ovarian cysts were appreciated, however, there was no evidence of acute disease on evaluation. Photodocumentation was obtained.\nA 5 mm port was then placed in the right upper quadrant. This was done under direct visualization and a blunt grasper was utilized to mobilize the appendix. Next, a 12 mm port was placed in the left lower quadrant lateral to the rectus musculature under direct visualization. Through this port, the dissector was utilized to create a small window in the mesoappendix. Next, an EndoGIA with GI staples was utilized to fire across the base of the appendix, which was done noting it to be at the base of the appendix. Next, staples were changed to vascular staples and the mesoappendix was then cut and vessels were then ligated with vascular staples. Two 6 X-loupe wires with EndoGIA were utilized in this prior portion of the procedure. Next, an EndoCatch was placed through the 12 mm port and the appendix was placed within it. The appendix was then removed from the 12 mm port site and taken off the surgical site. The 12 mm port was then placed back into the abdomen and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was recreated. The base of the appendix was reevaluated and noted to be hemostatic. Aspiration of warm saline irrigant then done and noted to be clear. There was a small adhesion appreciated in the region of the surgical site. This was taken down with blunt dissection without difficulty. There was no evidence of other areas of disease. Upon re-exploration with a video laparoscope in the abdomen and after this noting the appendix base to be hemostatic and intact. The instruments were removed from the patient and the port sites were then taken off under direct visualization. The CO2 pneumoperitoneum was released into the air and the fascia was approximated in the 10 mm and 12 mm port sites with #0 Vicryl ligature x2. Marcaine 0.25% was then utilized in all three incision sites and #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate the skin and all three incision sites. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.

She admits to some nausea associated with it. There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms. The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant. She had a leukocytosis of 12.8. She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis. Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy. The risks, benefits, complications of the procedure, she gave us informed consent to proceed.\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS:\nExploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it was slightly enlarged. The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts. There was no evidence of adnexal masses and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes. The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors. The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:\nThe patient was brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia. The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV. After adequate sedation was achieved, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle. Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was insufflated approximately 15 mmHg. Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty. A video laparoscope was inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen was explored. Next, a 5 mm port was inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region. This was inserted under direct visualization. Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal was created. This was performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision. A bladed trocar was inserted into the suprapubic region. This was done again under direct visualization. Maryland dissector was inserted into the suprapubic region and a window was created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum. This was done while the 5 mm trocar was used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly. Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix was transected and doubly stapled with this device. Next, the mesoappendix was doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device. The staple line was visualized and there was no evidence of bleeding. The abdomen was fully irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline. The abdomen was then aspirated. There was no evidence of bleeding. All ports were removed under direct visualization. No evidence of bleeding from the port sites. The infraumbilical and suprapubic ports were then closed. The fascias were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle. Once the fascias were closed, all incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl. The areas were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound.

Preoperative antibiotics were given. A time-out process was followed. Local anesthetics were infiltrated in the area of the proposed incision. A modified McBurney incision was performed. A very abnormal appendix was immediately found. There was a milky fluid around the area and this was cultured both for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. The distal end of the appendix had transformed itself into an abscess. The proximal portion was normal. The appendix was very friable and a no-touch technique was used. It was carefully dissected off the cecum, and then it was ligated and excised after the mesoappendix had been taken care of. Then the stump was buried with a pursestring of 2-0 Vicryl. The operative area was abundantly irrigated with warm saline and then closed in layers. The layer was further irrigated.

His creatinine has ranged between 4 and 4.5 over the past 6 months, since I have been following him. I have been trying to get him educated about end-stage kidney disease and we have been unsuccessful in getting him into classes. On his last visit, I really stressed the importance of him taking his medications adequately and not missing some of the doses, and he returns today with much better blood pressure control. He has also brought a machine at home, and states his blood pressure readings have been better. He has not gone to the transplant orientation class yet and has not been to dialysis education yet, and both of these I have discussed with him in the past. He also needs followup for his elevated PSA in the past, which has not been done for over 2 years and will likely need cardiac clearance if we ever are able to evaluate him for transplant.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nReally negative. He continues to feel well. He denies any problems with shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling in his legs, nausea or vomiting, and his appetite remains good.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n1. Vytorin 10/40 mg one a day.\n2. Rocaltrol 0.25 micrograms a day.\n3. Carvedilol 12.5 mg twice a day.\n4. Cozaar 50 mg twice a day.\n5. Lasix 40 mg a day.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS: On exam, his blood pressure is 140/57, pulse 58, current weight is 67.1 kg, and again his blood pressure is markedly improved over his previous readings.

He was last seen in this clinic on 05/29/2007 by Dr. X. This is the first time that I have met the patient. The patient's history of renal insufficiency dates back to 06/2006 when he was hospitalized for an HIV-associated complication. He is unclear of the exact reason for his hospitalization at that time, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was followed in our Renal Clinic for approximately one year. He had a baseline creatinine during that time of between 3.2 to 3.3. When he was initially diagnosed with renal insufficiency, he had been noncompliant with his HAART regimen. Since that time, he has been very compliant with treatment for his HIV and is seeing Dr. Y in our Infectious Disease Clinic. He is currently on three-drug antiretroviral therapy. His last CD4 count in 03/2008 was 350. He has had no HIV complications since he was last seen in our clinic. The patient is also followed by Dr. Z at the outpatient VA Clinic, here in ABCD, although he has not seen her in approximately one year. The patient has an AV fistula that was placed in late 2006. The latest blood work that I have is from 06/11/2008 and shows a serum creatinine of 3.8, which represents a GFR of 22 and a potassium of 5.9. These laboratories were drawn by his infectious disease doctor and the results prompted their recommendation for him to return to our clinic for further evaluation. The only complaint that the patient has at this time is some difficulty sleeping. He was given Ambien by his primary care doctor, but this has not helped significantly with his difficulty sleeping. He says that he has trouble getting to sleep. The Ambien will allow him to sleep for about two hours, and then he is awake again. He is tired during the day, but is not taking any daytime naps. He has no history of excessive snoring or apneic periods. He has no history of falling asleep at work or while driving. He has never had a formal sleep study. He does continue to work in sales at a local butcher shop.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nHe denies any change in his appetite. He has actually gained some weight in recent months. He denies any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort. He denies any pruritus. He denies any lower extremity edema. All other systems are reviewed and negative.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Stage IV chronic kidney disease with most recent GFR of 22.\n2. HIV diagnosed in 09/2006 with the most recent CD4 count of 350 in 03/2008.\n3. Hyperlipidemia.\n4. Hypertension.\n5.

Ziagen two daily.\n4. Lasix 20 mg b.i.d.\n5. Valsartan 20 mg b.i.d.\n6. Ambien 10 mg q.h.s.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nHe lives here in ABCD. He is employed at the sales counter of a local butcher shop. He continues to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily, as he has for the past 28 years. He denies any alcohol or illicit substances.\nFAMILY HISTORY:\nHis mother is deceased. He said that she had some type of paralysis before she died. His father is deceased at age 64 of a head and neck cancer. He has a 56-year-old brother with type-two diabetes and blindness secondary to diabetic retinopathy. He has a 41-year-old brother who has hypertension. He has a sister who has thyroid disease.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS: Weight is 191 pounds. His temperature is 97.1. Pulse is 94. Blood pressure by automatic cuff 173/97, by manual cuff 180/90.\nHEENT: His oropharynx is clear without thrush or ulceration.\nNECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\nHEART: Regular with normal S1 and S2. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. He has no JVD.\nLUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles.\nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended, without abdominal bruit or organomegaly.\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: He has difficulty with abduction of his right shoulder.\nACCESS: He has a right forearm AV fistula with an audible bruit and a palpable thrill. There is no sign of stenosis.

His ferritin is 258, iron is 55, and percent sat is 24.\nIMPRESSION:\nThis is a 48-year-old black male with stage IV chronic kidney disease likely secondary to HIV nephropathy, although there is no history of renal biopsy, who has been noncompliant with the Renal Clinic and presents today for followup at the recommendation of his Infection Disease doctors.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Renal. His serum creatinine is progressively worsening. His creatinine was 3.2 the last time we saw him in 05/2007 and today is 4.3. This represents a GFR of 19. This is stage IV chronic kidney disease. He does have vascular access and this appears to be ready to use. He is having some difficulty sleeping and it is possible that this represents some early signs of uremia. Otherwise, he has no signs or symptoms of uremia at this time. I am going to touch base with the dialysis educator and try to get The patient in to the dialysis teaching classes. He has already received some literature for the dialysis teaching, but has not yet enrolled in the classes. I have encouraged him to continue to exercise his right forearm. I am also going to contact the transplant coordinator and see if he can be evaluated for possible transplant. Given his progression of his chronic kidney disease, I will anticipate that he will need to start dialysis soon.\n2. Hypertension. I have added labetolol 100 mg b.i.d. to his antihypertensive regimen. He shows no signs at this point of volume overload, although if he does demonstrate this in the future, his Lasix could be increased. Goal blood pressure would be less than 130/80.\n3. Hyperkalemia. I am going to instruct him in a low-potassium diet and decrease his valsartan to 20 mg daily. I will have him return in one week to recheck his potassium. If his potassium continues to remain elevated, he may require initiation of dialysis for this.\n4. Bone metabolism. His PTH is elevated and I am going to add PhosLo 800 mg t.i.d. with meals. His corrected calcium is 9.7, and I would like to avoid calcium-containing phosphate bonders in this situation.\n5. Acid base. His bicarbonate is 18 and I will initiate the sodium bicarbonate 650 mg three tablets t.i.d.\n6. Anemia. His hemoglobin is at goal for this stage of chronic kidney disease. His iron stores are adequate.\n7. Nutrition. His albumin is 3.2 and this is fairly close to his baseline over the past several months.\n8. HIV. His most recent CD4 count is 350. He has been very compliant, it seems, with his antiretroviral therapy. He has followup with Dr. Y.\n9. Transplant candidacy. I have informed the patient that he may indeed be a candidate for transplant, although he is likely to need dialysis before he could be transplanted. I have instructed him to try to stop smoking. This is for making him a better candidate. I have also encouraged him to continue to be compliant with his antiretroviral therapies as this would be a requirement for transplant.\nDISPOSITION:\nThe patient is to return to clinic in one month's time.\nKeywords:\nnephrology, serum creatinine, gfr, bone metabolism, anemia, hyperkalemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, disease, infection, creatinine, potassium, transplant, dialysis, renal,"}

The patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant. After appropriate cross match and workup of HLA typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nEndstage renal disease.\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nEndstage renal disease.\nPROCEDURE:\nCadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:\n400 mL.\nFLUIDS:\nOne liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin.\nANESTHESIA:\nGeneral endotracheal.\nSPECIMEN:\nNone.\nDRAIN:\nNone.\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure without any complication.\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nThe patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion. After adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space. After this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat. Camper's and Scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery. Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery. Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia. Additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion. After these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection. After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery. Upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties. After the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane. This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly. The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well. The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery. This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery. After the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture. The right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection. After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well. An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein. This was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured. Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control. The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area. Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection. At this time, Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein. This was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length. The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked. The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area. A 5-0 double-ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 Prolene, these were tied down and secured. The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles. The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles. After such time the 5-0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again. After this was done and the artery was secured, the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over. The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow. The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney. The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow. At this time, all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed. The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified. Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry. This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion. Before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length. At this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well. Subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder. This was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again. Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation. Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself. At this time, an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again. This was inspected and noted for proper control. Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects. At this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time. The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved. A 1-0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior. This was secured and knots were dumped. Subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running Monocryl. The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable. Dr. A was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure.\nKeywords:\nnephrology, endstage renal disease, ethibond, satinsky clamp, aponeurosis, cadaveric, cross match, curvilinear incision, hemodialysis, iliac vein, pelvic fossa, peritoneum, recipient, renal transplant, transplant, transversalis fascia, superior and inferior poles, endstage renal, renal disease, vein, electrocautery, bladder, renal, intervention,"}

He was last seen in this clinic on 05/29/2007 by Dr. X. This is the first time that I have met the patient. The patient's history of renal insufficiency dates back to 06/2006 when he was hospitalized for an HIV-associated complication. He is unclear of the exact reason for his hospitalization at that time, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was followed in our Renal Clinic for approximately one year. He had a baseline creatinine during that time of between 3.2 to 3.3. When he was initially diagnosed with renal insufficiency, he had been noncompliant with his HAART regimen. Since that time, he has been very compliant with treatment for his HIV and is seeing Dr. Y in our Infectious Disease Clinic. He is currently on three-drug antiretroviral therapy. His last CD4 count in 03/2008 was 350. He has had no HIV complications since he was last seen in our clinic. The patient is also followed by Dr. Z at the outpatient VA Clinic, here in ABCD, although he has not seen her in approximately one year. The patient has an AV fistula that was placed in late 2006. The latest blood work that I have is from 06/11/2008 and shows a serum creatinine of 3.8, which represents a GFR of 22 and a potassium of 5.9. These laboratories were drawn by his infectious disease doctor and the results prompted their recommendation for him to return to our clinic for further evaluation. The only complaint that the patient has at this time is some difficulty sleeping. He was given Ambien by his primary care doctor, but this has not helped significantly with his difficulty sleeping. He says that he has trouble getting to sleep. The Ambien will allow him to sleep for about two hours, and then he is awake again. He is tired during the day, but is not taking any daytime naps. He has no history of excessive snoring or apneic periods. He has no history of falling asleep at work or while driving. He has never had a formal sleep study. He does continue to work in sales at a local butcher shop.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nHe denies any change in his appetite. He has actually gained some weight in recent months.

His ferritin is 258, iron is 55, and percent sat is 24.\nIMPRESSION:\nThis is a 48-year-old black male with stage IV chronic kidney disease likely secondary to HIV nephropathy, although there is no history of renal biopsy, who has been noncompliant with the Renal Clinic and presents today for followup at the recommendation of his Infection Disease doctors.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Renal. His serum creatinine is progressively worsening. His creatinine was 3.2 the last time we saw him in 05/2007 and today is 4.3. This represents a GFR of 19. This is stage IV chronic kidney disease. He does have vascular access and this appears to be ready to use. He is having some difficulty sleeping and it is possible that this represents some early signs of uremia. Otherwise, he has no signs or symptoms of uremia at this time. I am going to touch base with the dialysis educator and try to get The patient in to the dialysis teaching classes. He has already received some literature for the dialysis teaching, but has not yet enrolled in the classes. I have encouraged him to continue to exercise his right forearm. I am also going to contact the transplant coordinator and see if he can be evaluated for possible transplant. Given his progression of his chronic kidney disease, I will anticipate that he will need to start dialysis soon.\n2. Hypertension. I have added labetolol 100 mg b.i.d. to his antihypertensive regimen. He shows no signs at this point of volume overload, although if he does demonstrate this in the future, his Lasix could be increased. Goal blood pressure would be less than 130/80.\n3. Hyperkalemia. I am going to instruct him in a low-potassium diet and decrease his valsartan to 20 mg daily. I will have him return in one week to recheck his potassium. If his potassium continues to remain elevated, he may require initiation of dialysis for this.\n4. Bone metabolism. His PTH is elevated and I am going to add PhosLo 800 mg t.i.d. with meals. His corrected calcium is 9.7, and I would like to avoid calcium-containing phosphate bonders in this situation.\n5. Acid base. His bicarbonate is 18 and I will initiate the sodium bicarbonate 650 mg three tablets t.i.d.\n6. Anemia. His hemoglobin is at goal for this stage of chronic kidney disease. His iron stores are adequate.\n7. Nutrition. His albumin is 3.2 and this is fairly close to his baseline over the past several months.\n8. HIV. His most recent CD4 count is 350. He has been very compliant, it seems, with his antiretroviral therapy. He has followup with Dr. Y.\n9. Transplant candidacy. I have informed the patient that he may indeed be a candidate for transplant, although he is likely to need dialysis before he could be transplanted. I have instructed him to try to stop smoking. This is for making him a better candidate. I have also encouraged him to continue to be compliant with his antiretroviral therapies as this would be a requirement for transplant.\nDISPOSITION:\nThe patient is to return to clinic in one month's time.\nKeywords:\nconsult - history and phy., serum creatinine, gfr, bone metabolism, anemia, hyperkalemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, disease, infection, creatinine, potassium, transplant, dialysis, renal,"}

The patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant. After appropriate cross match and workup of HLA typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nEndstage renal disease.\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nEndstage renal disease.\nPROCEDURE:\nCadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:\n400 mL.\nFLUIDS:\nOne liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin.\nANESTHESIA:\nGeneral endotracheal.\nSPECIMEN:\nNone.\nDRAIN:\nNone.\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure without any complication.\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nThe patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion. After adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space. After this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat. Camper's and Scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery. Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery. Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia. Additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion. After these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection. After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery. Upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties. After the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane. This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly. The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well. The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery. This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery. After the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture. The right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection. After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well. An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein. This was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured. Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control. The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area. Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection. At this time, Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein. This was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length. The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked. The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area. A 5-0 double-ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 Prolene, these were tied down and secured. The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles. The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles. After such time the 5-0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again. After this was done and the artery was secured, the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over. The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow. The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney. The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow. At this time, all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed. The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified. Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry. This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion. Before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length. At this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well. Subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder. This was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again. Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation. Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself. At this time, an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again. This was inspected and noted for proper control. Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects. At this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time. The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved. A 1-0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior. This was secured and knots were dumped. Subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running Monocryl. The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable. Dr. A was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure.\nKeywords:\nsurgery, endstage renal disease, ethibond, satinsky clamp, aponeurosis, cadaveric, cross match, curvilinear incision, hemodialysis, iliac vein, pelvic fossa, peritoneum, recipient, renal transplant, transplant, transversalis fascia, superior and inferior poles, endstage renal, renal disease, vein, electrocautery, bladder, renal, intervention,"}

Initial plan was to let the patient stabilize for 2 weeks and perform the nephrectomy. At this point, the patient was unable to go home. The patient continually complained of pain. The patient required about 3 to 4 units of blood transfusions prior. The patient initially came in with hemoglobin less than 5. The hemoglobin prior to surgery was 10.\nRisks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, respiratory failure, morbidity and mortality of the procedure due to her low ejection fraction were discussed. Cardiac clearance was obtained. The patient was high risk, family and the patient knew about the risk.

The patient and family understood all the risks and benefits in order to proceed with the surgery.\nDETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:\nThe patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient had A-line triple-lumen catheter. The patient was placed in left side up, right side down oblique position. All the pressure points were well padded. The right fistula was carefully padded completely around it. Axilla was protected. The fistula was checked throughout the procedure to ensure that it was stable. The arms, ankles, knees, and joints were all padded with foam. The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape. OG and a Foley catheter were in place. A supraumbilical incision was made about 6 cm in size and incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue and through the fascia and peritoneum was entered sharply. There were some adhesions where the omentum was into the umbilical hernia, which was completely stuck. The omentum was released out of that just so we could obtain pneumoperitoneum. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained after using GelPort. Two 12-mm ports were placed in the left anterior axillary line, and mid clavicular line. The colon was reflected medially. Kidney was dissected laterally behind and inferiorly. There was large hematoma visualized with significant amount of old blood, which was irrigated out. Dissection was carried superiorly and the spleen was reflected medially. The spleen and colon were all intact at the end of the procedure. They were stable all throughout. Using endovascular GIA stapler, all the medial and lateral dissection was carried through the stapler to ensure that the patient had minimal bleeding due to low cardiac reserve. Hemostasis was obtained. The renal vein and the renal artery were stapled and there was excellent hemostasis.\nThe dissection was carried lateral to the adrenal and medial to the right kidney. The adrenal was preserved. The entire kidney was removed through the hand port. Irrigation was performed. There was excellent hemostasis at the end of the nephrectomy. Fibrin glue and Surgicel were applied just in case the patient had delayed DIC. The colon was placed back and 12-mm ports were closed under direct palpation using 0 Vicryl. The fascia was closed using loop #1 PDS in a running fashion and was tied in the middle. Please note that prior to the fascial closure, the peritoneum was closed using 0 Vicryl in running fashion. The subcuticular tissue was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The patient was brought to the recovery in a stable condition.\nKeywords:\nnephrology, laparoscopic, nephrectomy, laparoscopic hand assisted nephrectomy, triple lumen catheter, lumen catheter, running fashion, renal mass, renal bleed, dissection, hemostasis, kidney, renal,"}

The patient was found to have a complex mass in the upper pole and the lower pole of the kidney. MRI and CAT scan showed questionable renal mass, which could be malignant. Initial plan was to let the patient stabilize for 2 weeks and perform the nephrectomy. At this point, the patient was unable to go home. The patient continually complained of pain. The patient required about 3 to 4 units of blood transfusions prior. The patient initially came in with hemoglobin less than 5. The hemoglobin prior to surgery was 10.\nRisks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, respiratory failure, morbidity and mortality of the procedure due to her low ejection fraction were discussed. Cardiac clearance was obtained. The patient was high risk, family and the patient knew about the risk. The recommendation from the pulmonologist, cardiologist, and medical team was to get the kidney out at this point because the patient and the family stated that they would not do well at home without any intervention. The patient and family understood all the risks and benefits in order to proceed with the surgery.\nDETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:\nThe patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient had A-line triple-lumen catheter. The patient was placed in left side up, right side down oblique position. All the pressure points were well padded. The right fistula was carefully padded completely around it. Axilla was protected. The fistula was checked throughout the procedure to ensure that it was stable.

Lysis of adhesions and renal biopsy.\nANESTHESIA:\nGeneral endotracheal.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:\n100 Ml.\nFLUIDS:\nCrystalloid.\nThe patient was bowel prepped and was given preoperative antibiotics.\nBRIEF HISTORY:\nThe patient is a 73-year-old male, who presented to us with a referral from Dr. X's office with bilateral renal mass and renal insufficiency. The patient's baseline creatinine was around 1.6 to 1.7. The patient was found to have a 3 to 4-cm exophytic right renal mass, 1-cm renal mass inferior to that, and about 2-cm left renal mass. Since the patient had bilateral renal disease and the patient had renal insufficiency, the best option at this time had been cryoprocedure for the kidney versus partial nephrectomy, one kidney at a time. The patient understood all his options, had done some research on cryotherapy and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient had a renal biopsy done, which showed a possibility of an oncocytoma, which also would indicate that if this is not truly a cancerous lesion, but there is an associated risk of renal cell carcinoma that the patient will benefit from a cryo of the kidney.\nRisk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, bowel obstruction, ileus, injury to bowel, postoperative bleeding, etc., were discussed. The patient understood the risk of delayed bleeding, the needing for nephrectomy, renal failure, renal insufficiency, etc., and wanted to proceed with the procedure.\nDETAILS OF THE OR:\nThe patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was given preoperative antibiotics. The patient was bowel prepped. The patient was placed in right side up, left side down, semiflank, with kidney rest up. All the pressure points are very well padded using foam and towels. The left knee was bent and the right knee was straight. There was no tension on any of the joints. All pressure points were well padded. The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape all the way around. A Foley catheter and OG tube were in place prior to prepping and draping the patient. A periumbilical incision measuring about 6 cm was made. The incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia using sharp dissection. The peritoneum was open. Abdomen was entered. There were some adhesions on the right side of the abdomen, which were released using metz. Two 12-mm ports were placed in the anteroaxillary line and one in the midclavicular line. A gel porter was placed. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained. All ports were placed under direct vision, and the right colon was reflected medially. Duodenum was cauterized. Minimal dissection was done on the hilum and the Gerota's was opened laterally, and the renal masses were clearly visualized all the way around. Pictures were taken. Superficial biopsies were taken of 2 renal lesions using 3 different probes. The 2 lesions were frozen. The 2 probes were 2.4 mm and the other one was 3.1 mm in diameter. So the R3.8 and R2.4 long probes were used. Freezing/thawing, two cycles were done. The temperatures were -131, -137, -150 and the freezing time was 5 and 10 minutes each and passive sign was done. The exact times or exact temperatures are on the chart. There was a nice ice ball with each freezing and with passive sign. The probes were removed.\nThe probes were placed directly percutaneously through the skin into the renal lesions.\nAfter freezing/thawing, the probes were removed and to seal with Surgicel were placed. Pictures were taken after following total of 20 minutes were spent looking at the renal mass to make sure that there was no delayed bleeding. From the time the probes were removed, until the time the laparoscope was removed, was total of 30 minutes. So the masses were visualized for a total of 30 minutes without any pneumoperitoneum. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained again. Fibrin glue was placed over it just for precautionary measure. There was about a total of 100 mL of blood loss overall with the entire procedure. Please note that towels were used to prep off the colon and the liver to ensure there was no freezing of any other organ. The kidney was kept in the left hand at all times. Careful attention was drawn to make sure that the probe was deep enough, at least 3.5 to 4 cm in, to get the medial aspect of the tumors frozen. The laparoscopic vacuum ultrasound showed that there was complete resolution of these lesions. At the end of the procedure, after freezing/thawing and putting the fibrin glue, Surgicel, and EndoSeal, the colon was reflected medially. Please note that the perirenal fat was placed over the lesion to ensure that the frozen area of the kidney was not exposed to the bowel. Lap count was correct. Please note that renal biopsy for permanent section was performed on the superficial aspect of the lesions. No deeper biopsies were done to minimize the risk of bleeding. The 12-mm ports were closed using 0-Vicryl and the middle incision. The hand-port incision was closed using looped #1 PDS from both sides and was tied in the middle. Please note that the pneumoperitoneum was closed using 0-Vicryl in running fashion. After closing the abdomen, 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin and Dermabond was applied.\nThe patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.\nKeywords:\nnephrology, hand-assisted laparoscopic cryoablation, laparoscopic, cryoablation, bilateral renal mass, fibrin glue, laparoscopic cryoablation, renal insufficiency, renal lesions, renal biopsy, renal mass, insufficiency, renal, freezing/thawing, lesions,"}

Finger-to-nose testing is intact. PSYCHIATRIC: Fully alert and oriented.\nLABORATORY DATA:\nDecember 2004, creatinine was 1.5. Per report May 2006, creatinine was 1.8 with a BUN of 28. Labs dated 06/01/06, hematocrit was 32.3, white blood cell count 7.2, platelets 263,000, sodium 139, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, CO2 25, BUN 46, creatinine 2.3, glucose 162, albumin 4.7, LFTs are normal. CK was elevated at 653. A1c is 7.6%. LDL cholesterol is 68, HDL is 35. Urinalysis reveals microalbumin to creatinine ratio 59.8. UA was otherwise negative with a pH of 5. Today his urinalysis showed specific gravity 1.020, negative glucose, bilirubin, ketones and blood, 30 mg/dL of protein, pH of 5, negative nitrates, leukocyte esterase. Microscopic exam was bland.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Acute on chronic kidney failure. He has underlying stage III CKD with the GFR approximately 41 mL/min. He has episodic hypotension at home and low diastolic pressure here. His weight is down 2 to 3 Kg from June and he may be prerenal. He also has a history of prostatic hypertrophy and obstruction must be investigated. I am also concerned about his use of Chinese herbs which can cause chronic interstitial nephritis. There is no evidence of pyuria today although this can present with a fairly bland sediment. An additional concern is that TriCor can cause an artifactual increase in the creatinine due to changes in metabolism. I think this would be a diagnosis of exclusion.\n2. Orthostatic hypotension. He is maintaining systolic but his diastolic pressures are gotten in to a point where he may not be perfusing his brain well.\n3. Elevated creatine kinase consistent with myositis. It could be a result of Crestor alone or combination of TriCor and Crestor. I do not think this is enough to cause rhabdomyolysis, however.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. The patient was cautioned about using NSAIDs and told to avoid any further Chinese herbs.\n2. Recheck labs including CBC with differential, SPEP, uric acid and renal panel.\n3. Decrease atenolol to 25 mg daily.\n4. Decrease enalapril to 10 mg daily.\n5. Decrease Lasix to 20 mg daily.\n6. Stop Crestor.\n7. Check renal ultrasound.\n8. See him back in two weeks for review of the studies.\nKeywords:\nnephrology, acute on chronic kidney failure, orthostatic hypotension, elevated creatine kinase, acute kidney failure, acute on chronic, chronic kidney failure, coronary artery disease, stage iii ckd, acute kidney, hypertension diabetes, chronic kidney, prostatic hypertrophy, weak stream, lower extremity, coronary artery, artery disease, chinese herbs, kidney failure, blood pressure, kidney, hypertension, ckd, tricor, crestor, coronary, glucose, pressure, creatinine,"}

Lysis of adhesions and renal biopsy.\nANESTHESIA:\nGeneral endotracheal.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:\n100 Ml.\nFLUIDS:\nCrystalloid.\nThe patient was bowel prepped and was given preoperative antibiotics.\nBRIEF HISTORY:\nThe patient is a 73-year-old male, who presented to us with a referral from Dr. X's office with bilateral renal mass and renal insufficiency. The patient's baseline creatinine was around 1.6 to 1.7. The patient was found to have a 3 to 4-cm exophytic right renal mass, 1-cm renal mass inferior to that, and about 2-cm left renal mass. Since the patient had bilateral renal disease and the patient had renal insufficiency, the best option at this time had been cryoprocedure for the kidney versus partial nephrectomy, one kidney at a time. The patient understood all his options, had done some research on cryotherapy and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient had a renal biopsy done, which showed a possibility of an oncocytoma, which also would indicate that if this is not truly a cancerous lesion, but there is an associated risk of renal cell carcinoma that the patient will benefit from a cryo of the kidney.\nRisk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, bowel obstruction, ileus, injury to bowel, postoperative bleeding, etc., were discussed. The patient understood the risk of delayed bleeding, the needing for nephrectomy, renal failure, renal insufficiency, etc., and wanted to proceed with the procedure.\nDETAILS OF THE OR:\nThe patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was given preoperative antibiotics. The patient was bowel prepped. The patient was placed in right side up, left side down, semiflank, with kidney rest up. All the pressure points are very well padded using foam and towels. The left knee was bent and the right knee was straight. There was no tension on any of the joints. All pressure points were well padded. The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape all the way around. A Foley catheter and OG tube were in place prior to prepping and draping the patient. A periumbilical incision measuring about 6 cm was made. The incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia using sharp dissection. The peritoneum was open. Abdomen was entered. There were some adhesions on the right side of the abdomen, which were released using metz. Two 12-mm ports were placed in the anteroaxillary line and one in the midclavicular line. A gel porter was placed. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained. All ports were placed under direct vision, and the right colon was reflected medially. Duodenum was cauterized. Minimal dissection was done on the hilum and the Gerota's was opened laterally, and the renal masses were clearly visualized all the way around. Pictures were taken. Superficial biopsies were taken of 2 renal lesions using 3 different probes. The 2 lesions were frozen. The 2 probes were 2.4 mm and the other one was 3.1 mm in diameter. So the R3.8 and R2.4 long probes were used. Freezing/thawing, two cycles were done. The temperatures were -131, -137, -150 and the freezing time was 5 and 10 minutes each and passive sign was done. The exact times or exact temperatures are on the chart. There was a nice ice ball with each freezing and with passive sign. The probes were removed.\nThe probes were placed directly percutaneously through the skin into the renal lesions.\nAfter freezing/thawing, the probes were removed and to seal with Surgicel were placed. Pictures were taken after following total of 20 minutes were spent looking at the renal mass to make sure that there was no delayed bleeding. From the time the probes were removed, until the time the laparoscope was removed, was total of 30 minutes. So the masses were visualized for a total of 30 minutes without any pneumoperitoneum. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained again. Fibrin glue was placed over it just for precautionary measure. There was about a total of 100 mL of blood loss overall with the entire procedure. Please note that towels were used to prep off the colon and the liver to ensure there was no freezing of any other organ. The kidney was kept in the left hand at all times. Careful attention was drawn to make sure that the probe was deep enough, at least 3.5 to 4 cm in, to get the medial aspect of the tumors frozen. The laparoscopic vacuum ultrasound showed that there was complete resolution of these lesions. At the end of the procedure, after freezing/thawing and putting the fibrin glue, Surgicel, and EndoSeal, the colon was reflected medially. Please note that the perirenal fat was placed over the lesion to ensure that the frozen area of the kidney was not exposed to the bowel. Lap count was correct. Please note that renal biopsy for permanent section was performed on the superficial aspect of the lesions. No deeper biopsies were done to minimize the risk of bleeding. The 12-mm ports were closed using 0-Vicryl and the middle incision. The hand-port incision was closed using looped #1 PDS from both sides and was tied in the middle. Please note that the pneumoperitoneum was closed using 0-Vicryl in running fashion. After closing the abdomen, 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin and Dermabond was applied.\nThe patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.\nKeywords:\nsurgery, hand-assisted laparoscopic cryoablation, laparoscopic, cryoablation, bilateral renal mass, fibrin glue, laparoscopic cryoablation, renal insufficiency, renal lesions, renal biopsy, renal mass, insufficiency, renal, freezing/thawing, lesions,"}

She was thought to have bronchitis as well and was treated with antibiotics. During hospitalization she developed acute lower GI bleed and was transferred to intensive care unit and transfused packed red blood cells. GI was consulted, performed endoscopy, revealing diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon, with this being the suspected cause of hemorrhage. Plavix is being held for at least 10 days. Lovenox held as well. No further signs of bleeding. The patient's respiratory status did slowly improve to baseline. She is discharged and given the above noted medications.

The patient received 3 nebulizers at home without much improvement. He was subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to BiPAP.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nThe patient was admitted to the hospitalist service, treated with frequent small volume nebulizers, treated with IV Solu-Medrol and BiPAP support for COPD exacerbation. The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100s to mid 100s. The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin. The patient subsequently responded well as well received IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Zosyn. The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization. The patient subsequently was able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed. The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing BiPAP, was simply using supplemental O2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturations on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula. The patient was able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and was able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet. Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow was thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time. The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions that appeared to be unchanged. There was also more pronounced patchy alveolar opacity, which appeared to be, \"mass like\" in the right suprahilar region. This subsequently resolved and the patient's infiltrate slowly improved over the course of his hospitalization. On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a chest x-ray 2 views, which allowing for differences in technique revealed little change in the bibasilar infiltrates and atelectatic changes at the bases bilaterally. This was compared with an examination performed 3 days prior. The patient also had minimal bilateral effusions. The patient will continue with clindamycin for the next 2 weeks after discharge. Home health has been ordered and the case has been discussed in detail with Shaun Eagan, physician assistant at Eureka Community Health Center. The patient was discharged as well on a dysphagia 2 diet, thin liquids are okay. The patient discharged on the following medications.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Home oxygen 1 to 2 liters to maintain O2 saturations at 89 to 91% at all times.\n2. Ativan 1 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n3. Metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n4. Glucotrol 5 mg p.o. daily.\n5.

No refills.\n16. Clindamycin 300 mg p.o. q.i.d. x2 weeks, dispensed #64 with one refill.\nThe patient's aspiration pneumonia was discussed in detail. He is agreeable to obtaining a chest x-ray PA and lateral after 2 weeks of treatment. Note that this patient did not have community-acquired pneumonia. His discharge diagnosis is aspiration pneumonia. The patient will continue with a dysphagia 2 diet with thin liquids after discharge. The patient discharged with home health. A dietary and speech therapy evaluation has been ordered. Speech therapy to treat for chronic dysphagia and aspiration in the setting of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nTotal discharge time was greater than 30 minutes.\nKeywords:\ndischarge summary, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aspiration pneumonia, chronic, discharge, inflammatory, pneumonia, aspiration, obstructive, copd, bipap, pulmonary,"}

The chest pain occurred early Tuesday morning. She was treated with Plavix, Lovenox, etc., and transferred for coronary angiography and possible PCI. The plan was discussed with the patient and all questions answered.\nPROCEDURE NOTE:\nFollowing sterile prep and drape, the right groin and instillation of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the right femoral artery was percutaneously entered with a single wall puncture. A 6-French sheath inserted. Selective left and right coronary injections performed using Judkins coronary catheters with a 6-French pigtail catheter used to obtain left ventricle pressures, and a left ventriculography. The left pullback pressure. The catheters withdrawn. Sheath injection. Hemostasis obtained with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. She tolerated the procedure well.\nLeft ventricular end-diastolic pressure equals 25 mmHg post A wave. No aortic valve or systolic gradient on pullback.\nANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:\nI. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is\nnormal. The left anterior descending extends to the apex and has only minor luminal irregularities within the midportion of the vessel. Normal diagonal branches. Normal septal perforator branches. The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel with only minor irregularities with normal obtuse marginal branches.\nII. Right coronary artery: The proximal right coronary artery has a focal calcification. There is minor plaque with luminal irregularity in the proximal and midportion of the vessel with no narrowing greater than 10 to 20% at most.

History of hypertension.\nSUMMARY:\nThe patient is a 49-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in respiratory distress, and had to be intubated shortly after admission to the emergency room. The patient\u0092s past history is notable for a history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions in 1995 and 1999. The patient has recently been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been smoking up until three to four months previously. On the day of admission, the patient had the sudden onset of severe dyspnea and called an ambulance. The patient denied any gradual increase in wheezing, any increase in cough, any increase in chest pain, any increase in sputum prior to the onset of his sudden dyspnea.\nADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGENERAL: Showed a well-developed, slightly obese man who was in extremis.\nNECK: Supple, with no jugular venous distension.\nHEART: Showed tachycardia without murmurs or gallops.\nPULMONARY: Status showed decreased breath sounds, but no clear-cut rales or wheezes.\nEXTREMITIES: Free of edema.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nThe patient was admitted to the Special Care Unit and intubated. He received intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin. He received intravenous diuretic therapy. He received hand-held bronchodilator therapy. The patient also was given intravenous steroid therapy with Solu-Medrol. The patient\u0092s course was one of gradual improvement, and after approximately three days, the patient was extubated. He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patient\u0092s overall clinical picture suggested that he had a\nsignificant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular; his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further management on an outpatient basis.\nDIAGNOSTIC DATA:\nThe patient\u0092s admission laboratory data was notable for his initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103. The patient\u0092s electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The patent\u0092s CBC showed a white count of 24,000, with 56% neutrophils and 3% bands.\nDISPOSITION:\nThe patient was discharged home.\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\nHis diet was to be a 2 grams sodium, 1800 calorie ADA diet. His medications were to be Prednisone 20 mg twice per day, Theo-24 400 mg per day, Furosemide 40 mg 1-1/2 tabs p.o. per day; Acetazolamide 250 mg one p.o. per day, Lisinopril 20 mg. one p.o. twice per day, Digoxin 0.125 mg one p.o. q.d., nitroglycerin paste 1 inch h.s., K-Dur 60 mEq p.o. b.i.d.

Revascularization of the left anterior descending with angioplasty and implantation of a drug-eluting stent. Right heart catheterization and Swan-Ganz catheter placement for monitoring.\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nThe patient arrived from the emergency room intubated and ventilated. He is hemodynamically stable on heparin and Integrilin bolus and infusion was initiated. The right femoral area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine 2 mL was then filled locally. The right femoral artery was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by a 6-French vascular sheath. A guiding catheter XB 3.5 was advanced in manipulated to cannulate the left coronary artery and angiography was obtained. A confirmed occlusion of the left anterior descending artery with minimal collaterals and also occlusion of the right coronary artery, which is well collateralized. An angioplasty wire with present wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery, and could cross the area of occlusion within the stent. An angioplasty balloon measuring 2.0 x 15 was advanced and three inflations were obtained. It successfully re-canalized the artery. There is evidence of residual stenosis within the distal aspect of the previous stents. A drug-eluting stent Xience 2.75 x 15 was advanced and positioned within the area of stenosis with its distal marker adjacent to bifurcation with a diagonal branch and was deployed at 12 and 18 atmospheres. The intermittent result was improved. An additional inflation was obtained more proximally. His blood pressure fluctuated and dropped in the 70s, correlating with additional sedation. There is patency of the left anterior descending artery and good antegrade flow. The guiding catheter was replaced with a 5-French Judkins right catheter manipulated to cannulate the right coronary artery and selective angiography was obtained. The catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle and pressure measurement was obtained including pullback across the aortic valve. The right femoral vein was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by an 8-French vascular sheath. A 8-French Swan-Ganz catheter was then advanced under fluoroscopic and hemodynamic control and pressure stenting was obtained from the right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge position. Cardiac catheter was determined by thermal dilution. The procedure was then concluded, well tolerated and without complications. The vascular sheath was in secured in place and the patient return to the coronary care unit for further monitoring. Fluoroscopy time was 8.2 minutes. Total amount of contrast was 113 mL.\nHEMODYNAMICS:\nThe patient remained in sinus rhythm with intermittent ventricular bigeminy post revascularization. His initial blood pressure was 96/70 with a mean of 83 and the left ventricular pressure was 17 mmHg. There was no gradient across the aortic valve. Closing pressure was 97/68 with a mean of 82.\nRight heart catheterization with right atrial pressure at 13, right ventricle 31/9, pulmonary artery 33/19 with a mean of 25, and capillary wedge pressure of 19. Cardiac output was 5.87 by thermal dilution.\nCORONARIES:\nOn fluoroscopy, there was evidence of previous coronary stent in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex distribution.\nA. Left main coronary: The left main coronary artery is of good caliber and has no evidence of obstructive lesions.\nB. Left anterior descending artery: The left anterior descending artery was initially occluded within the previously stented proximal-to-mid segment. There is minimal collateral flow.\nC. Circumflex: Circumflex is a nondominant circulation. It supplies a first obtuse marginal branch on good caliber. There is an outline of the stent in the midportion, which has mild 30% stenosis. The rest of the vessel has no significant obstructive lesions. It also supplies significant collaterals supplying the occluded right coronary artery.\nD. Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a weekly dominant circulation. The vessel is occluded in intermittent portion and has a minimal collateral flow distally.\nANGIOPLASTY:\nThe left anterior descending artery was the site of re-canalization by angioplasty and implantation of a drug-eluting stent (Xience 15 mm length deployed at 2.9 mm) final result is good with patency of the left anterior descending artery, good antegrade flow and no evidence of dissection. The stent was deployed proximal to the bifurcation with a second diagonal branch, which has remained patent. There is a septal branch overlapped by the stent, which is also patent, although presenting a proximal stenosis. The distal left anterior descending artery trifurcates with two diagonal branches and apical left anterior descending artery. There is good antegrade flow and no evidence of distal embolization.\nCONCLUSION:\nAcute coronary artery syndrome with ST-segment elevation in anterior wall distribution, complicated with primary ventricular malignant arrhythmia and required defibrillation along intubation and ventilatory support.\nPreviously documented coronary artery disease with remote angioplasty and stents in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex artery.\nAcute coronary artery syndrome with ST-segment elevation in anterior wall distribution related to in-stent thrombosis of the left anterior descending artery, successfully re-canalized with angioplasty and a drug-eluting stent. There is mild-to-moderate disease of the previously stented circumflex and clinic occlusion of the right coronary artery, well collateralized.\nRight femoral arterial and venous vascular access.\nRECOMMENDATION:\nIntegrilin infusion is maintained until tomorrow. He received aspirin and Plavix per nasogastric tube. Titrated doses of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are initiated. Additional revascularization therapy will be adjusted according to the clinical evaluation.\nKeywords:\ncardiovascular / pulmonary, ventricular arrhythmia, coronary artery syndrome, st segment elevation, heart catheterization, selective bilateral coronary angiography, ventriculography, catheterization, swan-ganz catheter, anterior descending artery, drug eluting stent, coronary artery, angioplasty, stent, coronary, anterior, angiography, artery, heart,"}

The intermittent result was improved. An additional inflation was obtained more proximally. His blood pressure fluctuated and dropped in the 70s, correlating with additional sedation. There is patency of the left anterior descending artery and good antegrade flow. The guiding catheter was replaced with a 5-French Judkins right catheter manipulated to cannulate the right coronary artery and selective angiography was obtained. The catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle and pressure measurement was obtained including pullback across the aortic valve. The right femoral vein was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by an 8-French vascular sheath. A 8-French Swan-Ganz catheter was then advanced under fluoroscopic and hemodynamic control and pressure stenting was obtained from the right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge position. Cardiac catheter was determined by thermal dilution. The procedure was then concluded, well tolerated and without complications. The vascular sheath was in secured in place and the patient return to the coronary care unit for further monitoring. Fluoroscopy time was 8.2 minutes. Total amount of contrast was 113 mL.\nHEMODYNAMICS:\nThe patient remained in sinus rhythm with intermittent ventricular bigeminy post revascularization. His initial blood pressure was 96/70 with a mean of 83 and the left ventricular pressure was 17 mmHg. There was no gradient across the aortic valve. Closing pressure was 97/68 with a mean of 82.\nRight heart catheterization with right atrial pressure at 13, right ventricle 31/9, pulmonary artery 33/19 with a mean of 25, and capillary wedge pressure of 19. Cardiac output was 5.87 by thermal dilution.\nCORONARIES:\nOn fluoroscopy, there was evidence of previous coronary stent in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex distribution.\nA. Left main coronary: The left main coronary artery is of good caliber and has no evidence of obstructive lesions.\nB. Left anterior descending artery: The left anterior descending artery was initially occluded within the previously stented proximal-to-mid segment. There is minimal collateral flow.\nC. Circumflex: Circumflex is a nondominant circulation. It supplies a first obtuse marginal branch on good caliber. There is an outline of the stent in the midportion, which has mild 30% stenosis. The rest of the vessel has no significant obstructive lesions. It also supplies significant collaterals supplying the occluded right coronary artery.\nD. Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a weekly dominant circulation. The vessel is occluded in intermittent portion and has a minimal collateral flow distally.\nANGIOPLASTY:\nThe left anterior descending artery was the site of re-canalization by angioplasty and implantation of a drug-eluting stent (Xience 15 mm length deployed at 2.9 mm) final result is good with patency of the left anterior descending artery, good antegrade flow and no evidence of dissection. The stent was deployed proximal to the bifurcation with a second diagonal branch, which has remained patent. There is a septal branch overlapped by the stent, which is also patent, although presenting a proximal stenosis. The distal left anterior descending artery trifurcates with two diagonal branches and apical left anterior descending artery. There is good antegrade flow and no evidence of distal embolization.\nCONCLUSION:\nAcute coronary artery syndrome with ST-segment elevation in anterior wall distribution, complicated with primary ventricular malignant arrhythmia and required defibrillation along intubation and ventilatory support.\nPreviously documented coronary artery disease with remote angioplasty and stents in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex artery.\nAcute coronary artery syndrome with ST-segment elevation in anterior wall distribution related to in-stent thrombosis of the left anterior descending artery, successfully re-canalized with angioplasty and a drug-eluting stent. There is mild-to-moderate disease of the previously stented circumflex and clinic occlusion of the right coronary artery, well collateralized.\nRight femoral arterial and venous vascular access.\nRECOMMENDATION:\nIntegrilin infusion is maintained until tomorrow. He received aspirin and Plavix per nasogastric tube. Titrated doses of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are initiated. Additional revascularization therapy will be adjusted according to the clinical evaluation.\nKeywords:\nsurgery, ventricular arrhythmia, coronary artery syndrome, st segment elevation, heart catheterization, selective bilateral coronary angiography, ventriculography, catheterization, swan-ganz catheter, anterior descending artery, drug eluting stent, coronary artery, angioplasty, stent, coronary, anterior, angiography, artery, heart,"}

The patient has not used amphetamines for at least four to five months, according to the patient; however, he had onset of chest pain this evening.\nThe patient describes the pain as midsternal pain, a burning type sensation that lasted several seconds. The patient took one of his own nitroglycerin tablets without any relief. The patient became concerned and came into the emergency department.\nHere in the emergency department, the patient states that his pain is a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10. He feels much more comfortable. He denies any shortness of breath or dizziness, and states that the pain feels unlike the pain of his myocardial infarction. The patient has no other complaints at this time.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nThe patient's past medical history is significant for status post myocardial infarction in February of 1995 and again in late February of 1995.

Progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\nProgressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\nProgressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:\nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x4.\nGRAFTS PERFORMED:\nLIMA to LAD, left radial artery from the aorta to the PDA, left saphenous vein graft from the aorta sequential to the diagonal to the obtuse marginal.\nINDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:\nThe patient is a 74-year-old gentleman, who presented with six-month history of progressively worsening exertional angina. He had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved LV function. He was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries.\nFINDINGS DURING THE PROCEDURE:\nThe aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp. Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits. Radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality. All distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present. The smallest target was the PDA, which was about 1.5 mm in size. All the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater. The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems. He was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, Precedex drips. Cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes.\nDETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:\nThe patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table. After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately. The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion. Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.\nAfter prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed. Left internal mammary artery was taken down. Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques. Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques. Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.\nHeparin was given. Pericardium was opened and suspended. During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally. Only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery.\nPericardium was opened and suspended. Pursestring sutures were placed. Aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. With satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia. An initial dose of about 1500 mL was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart.\nPDA was exposed first. The right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation. Even in the PDA, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion. Arteriotomy on the PDA was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions. End radial to side PDA anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene. Next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed. Arteriotomy was performed. An end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene. This graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene. Next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and LIMA was accommodated in the slit on its way to the LAD. LAD was exposed. Arteriotomy was performed. An end LIMA to side LAD anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene. LIMA was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle.\nTwo stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch. Two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 Prolene. The patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed. Following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity. Temporary V-pacing wires were placed. Blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum. Left chest Blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed. After an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary V-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems. With satisfactory hemodynamics, good LV function on TEE and baseline EKG, heparin was reversed using protamine. Decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation. Hemostasis was assured. Mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy Vicryl for musculofascial closure, and Monocryl for subcuticular skin closure. Dressings were applied. The patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. He tolerated the procedure well. All counts were correct at the termination of the procedure. Cross clamp time was 102 minutes. Bypass time was 120 minutes. The patient was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, and Precedex drips.\nKeywords:\ncardiovascular / pulmonary, radial artery, lima, pda, obtuse marginal, exertional angina, coronary artery disease, triple-vessel, graft, conduit, ij triple-lumen catheter, cordis catheter, a-line, foley catheter, tee probes, coronary artery bypass grafting, cross clamp, mammary artery, saphenous vein, coronary artery, artery, cabg, coronary, grafting, aorta, angina, bypass,"}

After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately. The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion. Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.\nAfter prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed. Left internal mammary artery was taken down. Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques. Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques. Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.\nHeparin was given. Pericardium was opened and suspended. During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally. Only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery.\nPericardium was opened and suspended. Pursestring sutures were placed. Aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. With satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia. An initial dose of about 1500 mL was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart.\nPDA was exposed first. The right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation. Even in the PDA, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion. Arteriotomy on the PDA was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions. End radial to side PDA anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene. Next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed. Arteriotomy was performed. An end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene. This graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene. Next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and LIMA was accommodated in the slit on its way to the LAD. LAD was exposed. Arteriotomy was performed. An end LIMA to side LAD anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene. LIMA was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle.\nTwo stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch. Two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 Prolene. The patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed. Following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity. Temporary V-pacing wires were placed. Blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum. Left chest Blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed. After an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary V-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems. With satisfactory hemodynamics, good LV function on TEE and baseline EKG, heparin was reversed using protamine. Decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation. Hemostasis was assured. Mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy Vicryl for musculofascial closure, and Monocryl for subcuticular skin closure. Dressings were applied. The patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. He tolerated the procedure well. All counts were correct at the termination of the procedure. Cross clamp time was 102 minutes. Bypass time was 120 minutes. The patient was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, and Precedex drips.\nKeywords:\nsurgery, radial artery, lima, pda, obtuse marginal, exertional angina, coronary artery disease, triple-vessel, graft, conduit, ij triple-lumen catheter, cordis catheter, a-line, foley catheter, tee probes, coronary artery bypass grafting, cross clamp, mammary artery, saphenous vein, coronary artery, artery, cabg, coronary, grafting, aorta, angina, bypass,"}

The patient is not a great historian. Most of the history is obtained through the old history and chart that the patient has with her. According to what we can make out, she began experiencing nausea, vomiting, recurrent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain in 2001. She was initially seen by Dr. A back in September 2001 for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. During those times, it was suspected that part of her symptoms may be secondary to biliary disease and underwent a cholecystectomy performed in Oregon by Dr. A in August 2001. It was assumed that this was caused by biliary dyskinesia. Previous to that, an upper endoscopy was performed by Dr. B in July 2001 that showed to be mild gastritis secondary to anti-inflammatory use. Postoperatively she continued to have nausea and vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain similar to her gallbladder pain in the past. In addition, she had significant abnormal liver function tests with ALT in the 600's, AST 300's with a bilirubin 2.5 and alkaline phosphatase in the 200's. Ultrasound shows common bile duct of 6 mm post cholecystectomy. The patient was then eventually referred to Dr. W in Oregon. Given the abnormal liver function tests and abnormal ultrasound, Dr. W performed an ERCP with sphincterotomy in September 20, 2001. Because of the symptoms and the suspicions of Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, a sphincterotomy was performed during the ERCP. Procedure was uneventful. The patient did well for a few months, but unfortunately got hospitalized again in May 2002 for recurrence of the abdominal pain and markedly elevated liver function tests with ALT in the 600 to 900 range, again with nausea and vomiting. After transient elevation, her liver function tests would normalize.\nDuring her hospitalization, extensive work-up including CT scan, 24 hour urine collection for porphyrins, a percutaneous liver biopsy, and Hepatitis panel, all of which were normal. A repeat ERCP with placement of endobiliary stent was uneventful and did not show evidence of PBC or PSC. After placement of the biliary stent, according to Dr. W's note, it apparently helped the patient with her symptoms with decreased frequency of nausea, vomiting, and pain. MRI of the abdomen was also performed in May 2002 showing a horseshoe kidney, which was previously known on old CT scans. While the biliary stent was in place, the patient did have recurrent bouts of nausea and vomiting and pain rated 7 out of 10 in intensity. Finally in August 2002, the endobiliary stent was removed and there were no signs of obstruction. Thereafter, the patient actually did fairly well for about a year, but because of a recurrence of her symptoms, Dr. W actually sent the patient up to OHSU for evaluation of this continued fairly mysterious abdominal pain. The patient states that she saw Dr. A who recommended some laboratory tests and a repeat ERCP for further evaluation, but the patient did not want to go up to OHSU as she was somewhat unhappy with initial care.\nThen, over the course of the next several month, at the beginning of 2004, the patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and recurrence abdominal pain returned. In fact, recently as the last documentation in May and June, the patient visited Emergency Room several times due to her symptoms. Lab tests show normal CBC with no signs of elevated white count. AST and ALT were normal. Alkaline phosphatase was in the low 200's with minimally elevated lipase of 78. Bilirubin was completely normal. The patient was given some Zofran and that seemed to control her symptoms and then she was discharged and now referred to us for further evaluation. At the present time, the patient is not having any abdominal pain. She states she threw up three times in the morning and is feeling well at this point. Her abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting symptoms are random. It does not associate with food. It is not pre or post meal and occasionally will wake her up in the middle of the night. She has not lost any weight despite this chronic nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain. Her bowel habits have been fairly normal. No hematemesis or melena.

HENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae are anicteric. Nares are patent and symmetrical. The oropharynx is clear with moist mucus membranes and no obvious mucosal lesions. The tongue is midline. NECK: Supple without adenopathy, JVD, or thyromegaly. There's no supraclavicular adenopathy. LUNGS: Clear bilaterally with normal respiratory effort. BACK: Nontender to palpation and there's no CVA tenderness or obvious spinal deformity. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended and nontender to palpation throughout with no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly, masses, fullness or ascites. Bowel sounds were present and did appear normal.

SKIN: Warm and dry with normal color and no rashes.\nIMPRESSION:\nA 23-year-old female with fairly mysterious symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain status post cholecystectomy and ERCP with sphincterotomy. She continues to have very intermittent elevated liver function tests and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. There was some discussion with Dr. W in the past regarding extending the sphincterotomy to ensure that a complete sphincterotomy was performed if the patient should have sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, however, at this time I am reluctant to do so without further reviewing the patient's chart and investigating other avenues. I think we will check another repeat liver function test and I think it may be helpful to repeat a liver biopsy to ensure we are not missing other primary liver diseases before concentrating purely on the biliary tree itself. In addition, AMA will be obtained along with a liver function test. I would also like to obtain some discharge summaries from Dr. W's office to further clarify what has transpired over the past three years.\nPLAN:\n1. Obtain discharge summaries from Dr. W's office.\n2. Send the patient for a complete metabolic panel, AMA.\n3. Send the patient for ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided liver biopsy.\n4. The patient will return to see me in three weeks. We will consider further options pending on these results of the test and review of the patient's discharge summaries from Dr. W's office. If the patient should show symptoms of pain and elevated liver function tests to be consistent with Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, we may repeat the ERCP and extend the sphincterotomy. The entire case was discussed with the patient. The patient is agreeable to the current plan.
